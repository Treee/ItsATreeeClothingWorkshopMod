# One Way Mute Transmitter

## Attribution
The base Mute Transmitter code is from Killerek#0152 (Modding Discord). His initial idea he graciously made open source which I uploaded here and "maintain" as a fork. Thank you! Another big shout out to him for helping get this working on my side and subscribing to the open source model!!

## What is this?!

This mod allows a user to toggle mute the transmitter so they can still hear others but do not want to transmit themselves.

## Why?!

Why not?!
