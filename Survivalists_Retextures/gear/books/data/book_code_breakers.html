    <p>Ever since there have been secrets, the means to safely transmit information has been an priority for the participants of knowledge transfer. A common mode of encryption is Morse Code, named after Samuel Morse, the inventor of the telegraph in 1837. He designed a system that transmitted electrical impulses through a medium, most commonly, metal wire. There are instances during solar flares where the impulses were transmitted wirelessly through the atmosphere via magnetic waves. The encoded text characters are standardized sequences of two different signal durations called 'dots' and 'dashes' or 'dits' and 'dahs'.</p>
    <p>The standard notation for international morse code is as follows. It is common for experts in morse code to change their standard to confuse unwanted listeners.</p>
    <p>A .- B -... C -.-. D -..    E .   F ..-. G --. H .... I ..    J .--- K -.-  L .-.. M -- </p>
    <p>N -. O --- P .--. Q --.- R .-. S ...  T -    U ..- V ...- W .-- X -..- Y -.-- Z --..</p>
    <p>1 .---- 2 ..--- 3 ...-- 4 ....- 5 ..... 6 -.... 7 --... 8 ---.. 9 ----. 0 -----</p>
    <p>There are no standard patterns for punctuation, therefore to segment sentences, the work BREAK or STOP is used to terminate the ending of a completed word. For example, the phrase "Morse Code is fun. I use it all the time." would translate into "Morse Code is fun BREAK I use it all the time BREAK"</p>
    <p>-- --- .-. ... . -.-. --- -.. . .. ... ..-. ..- -. -... .-. . .- -.- .. ..- ... . .. - .- .-.. .-.. - .... . - .. -- . -... .-. . .- -.-</p>

    <p>Another common encryption technique is a substitution cipher, also known as Caesar's Cipher, Shift Cipher, Caeser's Code, or Caesar Shift and is considered one of the simplest and widely known cipher's. As more advanced encryption schemes developed, the Caesar Cipher becomes foundational for other ciphers, such as the Vigenere Cipher and ROT13. Given the simplicity of a single-alphabet substitution cipher, it is easily broken and offers essentially no communications security. This, however, is not meant to completely invalidate the Caseer Cipher. Without the aid of modern computing most complex encryption algorithms are not feasible without spending considerable time decrypting through advanced mathematics.</p>
    <p>The transformation can be represented by aligning two alphabets; the cipher alphabet is the plain alphabet rotated left or right by some number of positions. For example, below here is a Caesar Cipher using a left rotation of three places, equivalent to a right shift of 23.</p>
    <p>Base:         ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</p>
    <p>Cipher(3):XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW</p>
    <p>An example of using the Caesar Cipher in a phrase is as follows. Encrypt the phrase by shifting left by 3 and decrypt by shifting right 3. This cipher can be used as the basis for complex encryption that is quick to decode to knowledgable parties.</p>
