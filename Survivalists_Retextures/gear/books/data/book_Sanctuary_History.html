		<title>Sanctuary: Safety for the Living, Vengeance for the Dead</title>

		<p>Lieutenant Finnegan “Doc” Schmidt was a humble yet troubled man, due to having served four years in the Cold War as a combat medical officer, and being honorably discharged due to a nearly fatal wound. After his plane crashed on Deer Isle, Doc hopped from group to group, trying to find his place in this new world. Realising that he wouldn’t ever really “find” his place, this is when he decided to found a new town, and built the community from the ground up alongside Carl, a man who had previously lost his family, and divulged into a massive drug problem before finding his way to Sanctuary and making efforts to getting clean. As its namesake suggests, the town is a “Sanctuary” for most types. Any and all searching for a place to settle down while still making a name for themselves in these hard times are welcomed into the town. The settlement began to slowly grow into a warm welcoming community just north of Sandy Bay. They decided to live by a simple moral code; You do not kill unless you must. You will not steal you will ask for help, and you will not rob.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>Their strict anti-bandit policies are easy to abide by for most, but those that don’t will be swiftly dealt with in whatever way is seen fit by the people. And though Doc was the acting leader, the duty as the Mayor is to act as a diplomatic representative for the town, and occasionally make more difficult decisions when it comes to the town’s future and wellbeing. Sanctuary relies on a strict democratic voting system, so the townspeople have the power to make changes in the town in whichever ways they deem fit.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>Though times were obviously tough at first, clearing the area of the infected, locking down buildings that had been left in shambles by those that had previously resided there before the outbreak, and managing to supply residents with food and clean water, the struggle to thrive quickly faded as the town grew, more people, more resources. But also more problems. In the months after its founding there was little unrest, the occasional bandit being swiftly dealt with. Doc met with a few survivors he happened across in the area, calling themselves the Riders of Portland, a biker club that had been around and kicking before the world went to pieces. After some meetings about what each group believed in, and what they were about, Doc offered Hank, the president of the club, a place for them to stay in Sanctuary, if they were willing to be the muscle and security for the residents. Hank accepted, and they moved into one of the old abandoned warehouses, fixed it up, and called it home.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>Surviving and thriving for a time, Doc ran Sanctuary as a peace-loving mayor, alongside his co-leader and good friend, Carl. Growing to capacity and needing to delegate, he brought his newfound friends, Sheriff Gray Backster, and Ron and Diane Swanson, to leadership and just continued to grow. Sheriff Gray was keeping the town safe from small-time bandits and and the occasional thief that made their way into the town, Ron became the town’s number one source for supplies as he was the least worried to go out by himself and find any and everything the town and its residents may need, and Doc had made Diane the Deputy Mayor, as he believed she had what it took to help run the town in his absence, and should anything happen to him or Carl, he was sure the town would be in good hands.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>But all good things must come to an end. On a scavenging run in Portland Doc split off from the group telling only Carl where he was headed. Word had got to him that there was a small group located just north of the isle. Due to a bout of truly bad luck, the small boat he had found had engine problems, and exploded, knocking Doc unconscious. With his luck going from bad to worse, Doc ran into a group of devolved settlers that had taken to the taboo of consuming human meat, and slowly succumbing to dehydration, starvation, and stress, Doc accepted their offer of this food. After weeks, he started to come to his senses, and realized that he needed to get home. He needed to get back to Sanctuary. He  began to secretly build a small boat, and took just enough supplies to make it back, as to not alert this group that had taken him in, but whilst on the sea, he knew he couldn’t just waltz back into Sanctuary in his current state, with his current diet. So once he hit the shore, he took to killing and eating people that he had found in a small coastal town. Until one day, he heard a car pull up outside the house he had been squatting in, ready to head out and meet his new “prey”, only to be surprised by Carl standing there, staring at Doc, disheveled and soaked in blood, surrounded by half-eaten corpses, with a grim look on his face.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>Being a good friend of Doc, Carl knew that he couldn’t muster up the courage to shoot his friend right then and there as if he were a rabid animal, so he knocked him unconscious with the butt of his pistol. Carl managed to get Doc into the back of his car, and drove back to the tower just south of Sanctuary, where he resided. He cleaned up this “new” Doc, and worked with him on reentering the world. Doc tried his hardest to continue to lead his friends and neighbors, but still retained the appetite for his fellow man, and discreetly went about carving up their fallen enemies and comrades for a while. But he couldn’t retain his façade forever. All it took was one scrap of information to tear everything down, and the day that the journalist named James came to town, was the day everything began falling apart.</p>
		<br/>
		<p> Carl was the only member of Sanctuary’s council in town when the journalist arrived, and bore the news of unrest in Jamestown regarding Sanctuary’s southern expansion. Unbeknownst to the rest of the town at the time, both Carl and Doc had been descending into madness due to drug abuse and the kuru virus, respectively. So, in a drug-fueled mental break and back on his “meds” again, Carl dramatically escalated the situation took a large bite out of the reporter’s arm, and the opportunity presented itself to him to publicly execute and dismember the reporter, and let slip his and Doc’s secret as he told him, “Make some room in the fridge, we’ve got a fresh one”. Doc’s go at Mayor had come to an end. Diane had been noticing dark thoughts creeping their way into her head, and affecting her day-to-day life, and longed for the unknown and to be free to do as she pleased, when she pleased. As she had been hanging around the leaders of the town for a while now, she had noticed some interesting tastes, and let her mind wander to the darker side of life after the virus, and questioned whether or not she could, or would, eat her fellow man. With not much time given to her, she made the split decision to join Doc as they loaded up his Mustang with what little they had, and made for somewhere they could be safe. Once Doc and diane went into hiding and devolved into cannibalistic savages, Sanctuary was left in ruin, and slowly the residents started leaving, feeling unsafe and betrayed by the very people who had brought them in, offered them a home and a community. Carl had found his way back into the town, still under the influence of heavy drug usage, and began harassing the residents by throwing decaying body parts into their windows, on their roofs, and into the middle of the street. When asked to stop, he continued his antics, and was quickly met with a shotgun to the head in the form of Hank’s AA-12.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>All seemed lost, until Ron Swanson took up the mantle of Mayor. With sheriff Backster at his side, they slowly picked up the pieces and rebuilt the town from the ground up. Sanctuary began to flourish again, bringing in more people, and were working alongside with the riders now more than ever, since Hank had helped them rid of the problems that Carl had brought into the town.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>Until Nature took its toll on the island. A hurricane devastated the town, and all looked lost. The houses were in ruin and everything they had built was undone. However, there was hope in an unexplored territory only a few miles to the North East. One of their scavengers discovered a nearly untouched town, uninhabited and free of the dead. The town came together along with the Riders, and made the decision to pack what little they had left, and made for their new home. Finding the new location desirable, they quickly rebuilt what they had lost and once again thrived under the leadership of Mayor Swanson and Deputy Mayor Aiden, bringing new alliances into the fold, bringing trade, trust, and companionship to the island.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>However, with the news of another impending hurricane on the horizon, Ron and his council decided to move the town back to their original position, as many of the residents had missed the area they previously called home, and were more than willing to rebuild what they had lost there. The residents packed up what they could and took shelter, and once the storm had ravaged and passed, they made their way back to “Old Sanctuary” and began building, once again. With a sound resolve, and leaders that make it their personal mission to make sure that the residents of the town are looked after, and kept safe, it seems that neither man, nor nature can weather the foundation of Sanctuary.</p>
