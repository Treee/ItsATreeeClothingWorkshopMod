		<title>The Legend of Dollface</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<p>According to the legend, Dollface was first spotted in the wilderness around Stonnington. No one saw it at first, they only heard whispers flowing through the trees. Then one day a lone survivor was out hunting. He heard a whispering coming from behind him but as he turned around all he saw was a flicker of a cloak going behind the trees. </p>
		<br/>
		<p>He called out. Nothing. He moved further into the woods thinking he was just hallucinating from lack of sleep and food. As he lined up a shot on a deer he had in his sights, he heard the whisper again. He couldn’t make out what it was, he turned around to see a black cloak and something strange where the face should be. He pulled up his scope to get a better look at the thing following him. He was shocked to see it had a face like an old china doll. And then it was gone. </p>
		<br/>
		<p>That was the start of the legend of Dollface. After this the word spread like wildfire and people were fascinated. More stories came flocking in of people seeing a cloaked figure with a doll mask wandering in the woods, you would hear it’s whispers before seeing it. </p>
		<br/>
		<p>One day a man came back from a hunting trip with triumph written all over his face. Announcing he had shot Dollface, although he didn’t find the body he saw the blood trail on the floor. Nothing could survive that kind of wound, the hunter claimed. Weeks went by and people hadn’t heard any whisperings or seen any strange figures lurking in the woods. Was Dollface gone?</p>
		<br/>
		<p>Weeks later a few people were cutting through the woods by Stonnington when they came across the stench of blood, thinking it was probably a dead animal they followed the droplets on the ground. They arrived at a pile of human meat and bones. They stared in disbelief, the head of the dead person was found a few feet away propped up against a tree, but to the hikers it looked distorted. They moved closer for a better look. As they realised a china doll mask had been placed over the face they heard laughter in the distance. The hikers ran from the forest as fast as they could to tell people that Dollface had returned.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>People were going missing. Only a few here and there but enough that a pattern started to emerge, the only people that seemed to be going missing were going to be travelling through the woods or going hunting. Hunting parties went out in larger numbers with fears of never being seen again. The stories came in from many people who travelled through the woods, reporting hearing the whispers of Dollface just before finding a dead body, or sometimes just the body parts. But everytime they would find the head remaining with a china doll mask attached. </p>
		<br/>
		<p>Noone ever saw Dollface again. Only his murders and hear his whispers. The disappearances haven’t happened in a long while. Was it because people went into the woods better armed? Has Dollface moved on to some new forrest to terrorise? Or is he dead?</p>
