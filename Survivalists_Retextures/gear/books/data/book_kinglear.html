      KENT. I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall. GLOUCESTER. It did always seem so to us; but now, in the division of the kingdom, it appears not which of the Dukes he values most, for
      qualities are so weighed that curiosity in neither can make choice of either’s moiety. KENT. Is not this your son, my lord? GLOUCESTER. His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have so often blush’d to
      acknowledge him that now I am braz’d to’t. KENT. I cannot conceive you. GLOUCESTER. Sir, this young fellow’s mother could; whereupon she grew round-wombed, and had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere she had a
      husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault? KENT. I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper. GLOUCESTER. But I have a son, sir, by order of law, some year elder than this, who yet is no dearer
      in my account: though this knave came something saucily to the world before he was sent for, yet was his mother fair; there was good sport at his making, and the whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this
      noble gentleman, Edmund? EDMUND. No, my lord. GLOUCESTER. My Lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my honourable friend. EDMUND. My services to your lordship. KENT. I must love you, and sue to know you better.
      EDMUND. Sir, I shall study deserving. GLOUCESTER. He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again. The King is coming. Enter Lear, Cornwall, Albany, Goneril, Regan, Cordelia and Attendants. LEAR. Attend the
      lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester. GLOUCESTER. I shall, my lord.

      LEAR. Meantime we shall express our darker purpose. Give me the map there. Know that we have divided In three our kingdom: and ’tis our fast intent To shake all cares and business from our age; Conferring them on
      younger strengths, while we Unburden’d crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall, And you, our no less loving son of Albany, We have this hour a constant will to publish Our daughters’ several dowers, that future
      strife May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy, Great rivals in our youngest daughter’s love, Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn, And here are to be answer’d. Tell me, my daughters,—
      Since now we will divest us both of rule, Interest of territory, cares of state,— Which of you shall we say doth love us most? That we our largest bounty may extend Where nature doth with merit challenge.—Goneril,
      Our eldest born, speak first. GONERIL. Sir, I love you more than word can wield the matter; Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty; Beyond what can be valu’d, rich or rare; No less than life, with grace, health,
      beauty, honour; As much as child e’er lov’d, or father found; A love that makes breath poor and speech unable; Beyond all manner of so much I love you. CORDELIA. [Aside.] What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be
      silent. LEAR. Of all these bounds, even from this line to this, With shadowy forests and with champains rich’d, With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads, We make thee lady: to thine and Albany’s issue Be this
      perpetual.—What says our second daughter, Our dearest Regan, wife of Cornwall? Speak. REGAN. Sir, I am made of the self mettle as my sister, And prize me at her worth. In my true heart I find she names my very deed
      of love; Only she comes too short, that I profess Myself an enemy to all other joys Which the most precious square of sense possesses, And find I am alone felicitate In your dear highness’ love. CORDELIA. [Aside.]
      Then poor Cordelia, And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love’s More ponderous than my tongue.

      LEAR. To thee and thine hereditary ever Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom; No less in space, validity, and pleasure Than that conferr’d on Goneril.—Now, our joy, Although the last and least; to whose
      young love The vines of France and milk of Burgundy Strive to be interess’d; what can you say to draw A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak. CORDELIA. Nothing, my lord. LEAR. Nothing? CORDELIA. Nothing.
      LEAR. Nothing will come of nothing: speak again. CORDELIA. Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty According to my bond; no more nor less. LEAR. How, how, Cordelia? Mend your
      speech a little, Lest you may mar your fortunes. CORDELIA. Good my lord, You have begot me, bred me, lov’d me: I Return those duties back as are right fit, Obey you, love you, and most honour you. Why have my
      sisters husbands if they say They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed, That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry Half my love with him, half my care and duty: Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,
      To love my father all. LEAR. But goes thy heart with this? CORDELIA. Ay, my good lord. LEAR. So young, and so untender? CORDELIA. So young, my lord, and true. LEAR. Let it be so, thy truth then be thy dower: For,
      by the sacred radiance of the sun, The mysteries of Hecate and the night; By all the operation of the orbs, From whom we do exist and cease to be; Here I disclaim all my paternal care, Propinquity and property of
      blood, And as a stranger to my heart and me Hold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian, Or he that makes his generation messes To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom Be as well neighbour’d, pitied, and
      reliev’d, As thou my sometime daughter. KENT. Good my liege,— LEAR. Peace, Kent! Come not between the dragon and his wrath. I lov’d her most, and thought to set my rest On her kind nursery. [To Cordelia.] Hence and
      avoid my sight! So be my grave my peace, as here I give Her father’s heart from her! Call France. Who stirs? Call Burgundy! Cornwall and Albany, With my two daughters’ dowers digest this third: Let pride, which she
      calls plainness, marry her. I do invest you jointly with my power, Pre-eminence, and all the large effects That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course, With reservation of an hundred knights, By you to be
      sustain’d, shall our abode Make with you by due turn. Only we shall retain The name, and all the addition to a king; the sway, Revenue, execution of the rest, Beloved sons, be yours; which to confirm, This coronet
      part between you.

      KENT. Royal Lear, Whom I have ever honour’d as my king, Lov’d as my father, as my master follow’d, As my great patron thought on in my prayers.— LEAR. The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft. KENT. Let it
      fall rather, though the fork invade The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man? Think’st thou that duty shall have dread to speak, When power to flattery bows? To
      plainness honour’s bound When majesty falls to folly. Reverse thy state; And in thy best consideration check This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgement, Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least; Nor
      are those empty-hearted, whose low sounds Reverb no hollowness. LEAR. Kent, on thy life, no more. KENT. My life I never held but as a pawn To wage against thine enemies; ne’er fear to lose it, Thy safety being the
      motive. LEAR. Out of my sight! KENT. See better, Lear; and let me still remain The true blank of thine eye. LEAR. Now, by Apollo,— KENT. Now by Apollo, King, Thou swear’st thy gods in vain. LEAR. O vassal!
      Miscreant!
