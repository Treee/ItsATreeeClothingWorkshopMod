      Three days since the campout was attacked by that deranged man with blood
      all over his face and after running for what seemed all night I woke to
      the daylight far from my campsite. Making my way back took effort and
      exhausted me until I saw the sight of the attack. All living, now turned,
      I could not return.

      I lost count of the days. Wandering the isle avoiding the dead becomes
      harder each day as more join their ranks. I have found a small shelter
      inside a cave that is easily blocked off and learned to make food that
      sustains me for long periods of time by growing my own crops and making
      stew with meat. If i get lucky scavenging I can find bread that hasn't
      spoiled and make a sandwich for on the go eating. Sometimes I get caught
      outside at night and need to make a leantoo shelter out of long and short
      sticks. Storing wood for the winter is important so I found nails and
      planks make excellent boxes for holding wood nearby. Being far from water
      I needed to make a well so some rope and a bucket helped start that
      effort; took me forever to find enough stones and mortar however. Once the
      well was made I had more time to work on other things instead of trekking
      water from the river. A sun shade made with sticks and camo netting I
      found made for a great hideout in the woods near the rock face. One day I
      was fiddling with my rifle scope and a tool in hand. I was able to affix
      it on another rifle I had nearby. Very useful. The amount of rope needed
      to do anything useful is insane. Rags or guts can be used to make rope...
      not for the squeemish. Lately I have been burning the weeds nearby and it
      smells nice. I rolled some up in a piece of paper and it got me really
      high... I am not sure if I liked it. In my spare time I made a workbench
      for all the building I am doing. I used some sturdy logs as the legs and
      planks for the sides and top I wonder what I can build with it. I am
      running out of space on this paper. I will try to rip some pages out of a
      book with my knife to make a journal.
