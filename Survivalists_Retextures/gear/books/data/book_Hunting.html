    <br />
    <p>PROLOGUE</p>
    <br />
    <p>I’ve never written a book before..</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      But it’s grown on me to write a bit in the evenings after a long day hunting, sitting in front of the fireplace while enjoying a drink and my smoking pipe. Waiting for the next day to head back into the beautiful
      nature out there. If I keep drinking at the pace I do every night, who knows how long I’ll be around for or even be able to remember for myself all the experience I’ve built up over the years of hunting. God knows
      I’ll never have a son or daughter to pass this down to either, so maybe writing something down in this book will be helpful to someone, at some point, even after I am gone..
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Ever since the world went to shit I’ve slowly learned how to survive as best I can out in nature, making my scavenging trips into the zombie and bandit infested towns as few and far apart as possible. I’ve been
      traveling a lot over the years of surviving, but lately Deer Isle has been my home for a full season now. There have been some minor changes in the wildlife during these times, so depending on when this book might
      be read, there could be some changes from when it was written. Humanity's impact on nature is well known, although the ones left of us are few, how many hunters out there at the same time on a small island like
      this might have a long term impact, and not to mention the bio-hazards that are here definitely could interfere. I have yet to make much out of it’s long term impact on the wildlife on Deer Isle, I have not been
      here enough years and I am no scientist, but there are some clear signs it has had some impact already.. I’ll get back to that when listing the different types of animals you can encounter.

    <p>“HOW” TO HUNT</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Put on some good hiking shoes, sling a hunting rifle over your shoulder and, if possible, bring some food and drink and start walking! Head into the forests and just travel, the longer you travel the better are
      your chances of eventually finding something. Enjoy nature, take in the sights and go slow, stop often and LISTEN. Teaching tracking is not a thing I will go into here, when you become experienced enough you might
      figure that out over time. The best way to start is to get out there and listen to nature, figure out what is what and stalk the ones you are after when you hear the right animal call.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>ANIMALS OF DEER ISLE</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      ROE DEER: The doe and the roebuck. Distinct calls, with small variations between the genders. The roebuck can almost sound like strange “barking”, while the doe has more high pitched screams, both can utter two
      short “barks” or “screams” in quick succession, or just a single call, in variation. They usually call out for each other when alone and/or separated, but still make sounds while moving together to let each other
      know where they are. Perhaps even in hopes to attract others to join their bevy, or herd. They usually go in pairs unless they are alone here on Deer Isle. I have rarely seen more than two together on this island.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      BOARS: By the untrained ear I guess they could be confused with the roe deer at first for some, but they are fairly distinct to the trained listener or when you get closer. Sounds more like a rough pig scream when
      it roars loudly, but if you sneak up close to them you can hear classic pig grunting and snorting. Hard to tell the genders apart from a distance. Much meat on them, but some pieces might be a bit lean. The number
      of boars in a sounder (group) varies, but here I have mainly seen them in pairs, sometimes a trio.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      RED DEER: The hind and the stag. Was at first very hard to find on this island, but they seem to finally have made it back after last winter at the time of writing this. Very distinct calls, if you hear a stag you
      know. The hind makes quite similar sounds as the stag, but the stag is more profound. The number of deers in a parcel (group) can vary (2-4). They usually travel together but some stags travel alone. I have yet to
      see a group of them close together here on Deer Isle yet at the time writing this, but they have just reappeared on the island. Rich in meat, and the heads can be nice to save as a trophy, or even wear if you know
      how to make and attach a strap to it.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>HARES: Almost impossible to spot, they are shy and live in holes in the ground. No way of hunting them just by going after sounds, here you need different tactics which I’ll write more about later.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Then there's the predators and dangerous game:</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      WOLVES: Normally travels in packs of 4-5, but there have been lone wolves attacking survivors as well. Very distinct calls, you can’t really go wrong or miss hearing wolves howl and when you do they have caught
      your scent, so get ready.. I will touch on tactics later. I have also experienced not hearing a warning of the distant howl, if you hear barking like those of a dog nearby, they are very close. I had one jump out
      of a bush on me once, without any warning other than a few barks right before he charged me. Hard to tell the genders apart from a distance. The meat is a bit tough, but absolutely edible.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      BIO-WOLVES: A second segment is needed on this animal here on Deer Isle: probably because of the radiated bio-zones and strange evolution happening here, some wolves show obvious signs of being affected, or
      infected even. These “bio-wolves” as some call them are mutated almost beyond recognition and can scare even the hardiest of survivors shitless at first encounter. They seem tougher than the normal ones, but still
      go down the same way with some well placed shots. Their meat is not edible, except by those who mutated themselves..
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      BEARS Travels alone, but where there is one there could be more. Has a distinct roar you can hear from a distance, be wary. Hard to tell the genders apart from a distance. Plenty of big juicy meat steaks and their
      heads will make a nice trophy to boast about and even wear without much work needed. Do NOT go heedlessly out hunting these beasts unless prepared! I have heard rumors about bears being affected by the bio-zones
      leading to mutations as well, but have yet to be able to confirm or see any solid evidence of this myself, yet. You might have noticed I have not mentioned anything about cows, pigs, sheep or goats, but as a HUNTER
      I do not consider these as something to HUNT as they are, or were, domesticated animals and I will not go any further into these.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>HUNTING TACTICS and ANIMAL BEHAVIOR</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      First I want to get into sustainability and humane hunting quickly: To lower the chances of missing or wounding the animal and making it suffer needlessly, heart/lung shots are always recommended! If you are
      hunting for the pelts however, and you are a steady enough shot and an experienced hunter; a headshot leaves the most pristine pelts. For the best wildlife management in order to keep a sustainable amount to keep
      hunting in the future, only take out males if you have a choice between the genders. In the beginning of this book I wrote how to go out and look for wild game, now I’ll go into what I do once I located the prey:
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      BOAR and DEER: Once I locate an animal or a group, I approach them carefully and slowly. Do not rush headless towards the sound as they scare easily and will run away at the first sign of danger. Use the terrain to
      your advantage when trying to get close to locate them, look for openings in the trees and try to get the high ground for a better overview. Take your time, once you see one see if you can hold your shot a bit in
      order to make sure it is alone, sometimes there are two. When you take your time to observe the animals you’ll likely see the direction they travel, use that to position yourself best for a potential followup shot
      on the second one, keep them as close as possible to each other in your sight so your rifle doesn’t have to travel far for the followup shot on the second animal. If you are lucky and skilled then, you can double
      your harvest during the same hunting situation! A double barreled rifle like the Blaze is the best in these situations in my opinion as you do not need to chamber a new shot to be able to shoot again. Unless of
      course you 'are an uncultured brute' that hunt with a semi automatic military rifle. Should you miss or be so unlucky as to scare them off before you get a chance to shoot, try to locate in what direction they
      flee. Follow a short bit if needed then stop and wait for them to calm down and start listening again. Eventually you will hear them start calling for their mates once they calmed down, then repeat the first steps
      and try again
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      HARES: Are small and very shy creatures that reside in the forests and can be very hard to spot, and even harder to shoot. Although I do have fond memories of a wild hare boom season many years ago where I was able
      to walk the fields with my double barrel shotgun and be able to shoot them out in the open. But those years are far between and not something I imagine happening on Deer Isle anytime soon. However there are ways of
      catching them; by using snares and bait. Wrap some metal wire around a stick and make a small loop or noose, plant it in the ground and add some bait. Fruit or vegetables seems to be their fancy. Do not use worms,
      unless you want a nice chicken steak. Leave it for a little while and check on it later, but do not forget about it for too long. Not much meat, but their hind legs are juicy and make for a nice lunch in the wild.
      But their pelts are nice and can add to your stack of leather in small portions one at a time.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      WOLVES: Going out to actively hunt wolves is a lot like fishing, with the main difference being you have to use yourself as bait.. I have only once in my hunting career, some years ago now, been able to get the
      drop on a pack of wolves from such a distance that they had not already caught my scent. But that was not on Deer Isle. When actively going out to hunt wolves you need local knowledge on where they roam, then go
      look for them prepared and always on alert. Here it is important to keep your cool and stand your ground when they come for you, don’t panic and let them surround you. It is vital to always keep an eye on your
      surroundings and have a backup plan for if or when they might come for you. Open ground between them and you so you get as many shots off from a far before they get too close, and have a backup weapon or two for
      close range. Usually, if you take out the alpha or ¾ of the pack, the rest will run off. Although the bio wolves seem more aggressive that way. Personally I use my hunting rifle to start with up until they get
      closer, then switch to a trusty double barrel shotgun when they are up close. And lastly, if there are any left and I don’t have time to reload the shotgun, my trusty gool ol’ sidearm in the form of a 1911. Seeing
      I am attacked in terrain that allows this approach, of course. No situation encountering wolves is the same. Being able to climb something is of course the safest location, but not often possible when you actively
      need to move around in the terrain not knowing when they might strike. In the swamp area of Deer Isle there are many small bridges over small ponds that make excellent placement as the wolves try to avoid water,
      have a narrow path to follow to get to you and they are also not well used to walking on these, giving you a tactical advantage in holding them off. Take mental notes of where these are when passing them, in case
      there is one to retreat to when the wolves sniff you out.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      BEARS: Be wary! These creatures are not to be underestimated and have the strength of ten grown men. They can be heard from a distance in the form of growling and roars. Will stand up on their hind legs when they
      are alert and sense something or someone near. Will charge and attack if you get too close. If you only take one thing from this book let it be this: DO NOT shoot at a bear unless you KNOW you will kill it before
      it reaches you. And these beasts are very fast.. The good old tip of “play dead” is not a bad one: The bear might knock you out, but if it does, stay down, keep quiet and eventually the bear will walk away. You
      see, most bears only charge unprovoked to scare you off and do not intend on killing but rather scare you away from their territory. But a wounded bear is probably one of the most dangerous creatures out there and
      will not stop mauling you after you are knocked out, which they’ll easily do with just one hit from their massive clawed paws. Protection in the way of helmets and body armor probably helps you withstand a few more
      blows, but I myself never carry that type of heavy equipment out in the woods so I have no experience on that part, and would rather not test it either. Hunting bears is probably the field I have the least
      experience in, as I have a massive respect for these beats. But back in my slightly younger years I did do some active bear hunting. I had to change out some of my standard hunting gear though for more firepower
      and used to bring an old automatic rifle in the form of an AK. My tactic then was to locate them in the same way described with the deers and boars, get as much range between me and them before I pulled them in
      with a shot or two in the head from my hunting rifle, then switch to the AK as it charged me and “let it rip” as it came closer. This is a very dangerous tactic though, miss a few or too many shots and it will get
      to you. But by keeping your cool and making sure most of the shots hit, then going full auto as it is about to get to you, the bear would fall dead at my feet.. The biggest adrenaline rush I’ve ever had out
      hunting, but I quit while I was ahead as it was too dangerous. Bear traps, if you can get a hold of one, are a great piece of equipment to help your odds. Place one in between you and the bear before you pull it
      in, just make sure it steps on it.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>YOU KILLED SOMETHING! NOW WHAT?</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Congratulations, you made a kill! Once you downed your prey, take out your hunting knife, or whatever knife you have and gut the animal as soon as you can to avoid the meat getting contaminated by the bacterias in
      the guts. Start with the belly, cut from the bottom up carefully so as not to burst the stomach, then pull out all the guts. Lastly, cut the meat into pieces. Should you be in need of a rope, you can make one out
      of the guts somewhat easily using your knife. The bones can be carved into fishing hooks. And the fat can either be cooked or you can use to grease up a torch if you need light at night; just wrap some rags around
      a long or short stick to make a torch,then rub the fat in the cloth for a longer lasting flame.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      PRESERVING THE FOOD: Meat will spoil eventually if not prepared right, and you will get sick if you eat it raw. These pieces you just sliced can be cooked over a fire using a sharpened long stick, or placed on a
      fireplace found in houses for baking or smoking. If you have a cooking pot, save some of the fat and put it in there along with the meat for a nice baked finish. If you do not use fat in a cooking pot the meat will
      burn. You can also add water to the cooking pot to boil it if you don't have fat. The guts can be used to make sausages, just stuff the meat in there, and voilá! Then these sausages can be either baked or smoked
      like the other pieces. If you have any vegetables you can combine those with the meat to make a nice stew, just be sure to boil the stew before eating. For longtime storing the meat, combine a couple pieces
      together and cram it into an old can you probably have on you from earlier. You can combine three of these into one full can making it a total of 6 pieces into a full one. Then find a fireplace or similar where you
      can either smoke or bake the content. (Note though: In order to seal the can, I did not get good results when the meat was smoked when I learned how to seal it, so I’ve only baked it.) Then lastly seal the lid with
      a pair of pliers if you plan on storing it for a long time.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      PELTS: To best respect the animal you killed, it is important to make the most out of all parts of it and the pelts can be used for various things, mainly leatherworking or taxidermy. But also to keep you warm in
      the field. Hold on to the pristine pelts if you plan to trade these away to taxidermists, or plan on experimenting with that yourself. If you need room to carry all the pelts, try to sew a peltbag using a basic
      sewing kit on one that doesn’t seem to be worth much, in order to save the best ones. This can be filled with lots of pelts and still be stuffed into your backpack. If you want to prepare the pelts into raw leather
      for further processing by a leatherworker, take your knife to the pelts and scrape off all the fur. This way the pelt also might take up less space in your backpack once it's scraped and stacked together. Are you
      cold? Try combining two together to make a vest, this will surely keep you warm even in the coldest conditions! Or if you have across a wolf or bear pelt that might have got a little beating and is no use for a
      taxidermist, put your knife to it and cut yourself a nice cowl to wear over your shoulders. That’ll keep you nice and warm and surely give you some respectful looks coming back to town, and credibility as a proper
      hunter!
