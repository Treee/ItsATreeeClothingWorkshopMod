# What Is Crafting Plus?

Crafting Plus is a _simple_ framework that allows advanced recipes with multiple ingredients. DayZ vanilla is currently limited to the combination of **only** two items at a time. Crafting Plus allows any object to serve as a crafting workbench given a list of attachments. Like vanilla, you register recipes with ingredients on slots and required quantities for a specific crafted item.
