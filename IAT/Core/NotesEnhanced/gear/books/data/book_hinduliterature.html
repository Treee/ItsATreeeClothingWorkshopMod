      "Far away in Behar there is a forest called Champak-Grove,[7] and in it had long lived in much affection a Deer and a Crow. The Deer, roaming unrestrained, happy and fat of carcase, was one day descried by a
      Jackal. 'Ho! ho!' thought the Jackal on observing him, 'if I could but get this soft meat for a meal! It might be—if I can only win his confidence,' Thus reflecting he approached, and saluted him. 'Health be to
      thee, friend Deer!' 'Who art thou?' said the Deer. 'I'm Small-wit, the Jackal,' replied the other. 'I live in the wood here, as the dead do, without a friend; but now that I have met with such a friend as thou, I
      feel as if I were beginning life again with plenty of relations. Consider me your faithful servant.' 'Very well,' said the Deer; and then, as the glorious King of Day, whose diadem is the light, had withdrawn
      himself, the two went together to the residence of the Deer. In that same spot, on a branch of Champak, dwelt the Crow Sharp-sense, an old friend of the Deer. Seeing them approach together, the Crow said, 'Who is
      this number two, friend Deer?' 'It is a Jackal,' answered the Deer, 'that desires our acquaintance.' 'You should not become friendly to a stranger without reason,' said Sharp-sense. 'Don't you know?' "To folks by
      no one known house-room deny:— The Vulture housed the Cat, and thence did die." 'No! how was that?' said both. 'In this wise,' answered the Crow

      "In the country of Kanouj there was a King named Virasena, and he made his son viceroy of a city called Virapoora. The Prince was rich, handsome, and in the bloom of youth. Passing through the streets of his city
      one day, he observed a very lovely woman, whose name was Lávanyavati—i.e., the Beautiful—the wife of a merchant's son. On reaching his palace, full of her charms and of passionate admiration for them, he despatched
      a message to her, and a letter, by a female attendant:—who wonders at it?— 'Ah! the gleaming, glancing arrows of a lovely woman's eye! Feathered with her jetty lashes, perilous they pass us by:— Loosed at venture
      from the black bows of her arching brow they part, All too penetrant and deadly for an undefended heart.' Now Lávanyavati, from the moment she saw the Prince, was hit with the same weapon of love that wounded him;
      but upon hearing the message of the attendant, she refused with dignity to receive his letter. 'I am my husband's,' she said,'and that is my honor; for— 'Beautiful the Koíl[10] seemeth for the sweetness of his
      song, Beautiful the world esteemeth pious souls for patience strong; Homely features lack not favor when true wisdom they reveal, And a wife is fair and honored while her heart is firm and leal.' What the lord of
      my life enjoins, that I do.' 'Is such my answer?' asked the attendant. 'It is,' said Lávanyavati. Upon the messenger reporting her reply to the Prince, he was in despair. 'The God of the five shafts has hit me,' he
      exclaimed, 'and only her presence will cure my wound.' 'We must make her husband bring her, then,' said the messenger. 'That can never be,' replied the Prince. 'It can,' replied the messenger— 'Fraud may achieve
      what force would never try:— The Jackal killed the Elephant thereby.' 'How was that?' asked the Prince. The Slave related:—

      Then spake the Royal Princes to Vishnu-Sarman, "Reverend Sir! we have listened to the 'Winning of Friends,' we would now hear how friends are parted." "Attend, then," replied the Sage, "to 'the Parting of Friends,'
      the first couplet of which runs in this wise— 'The Jackal set—of knavish cunning full— At loggerheads the Lion and the Bull.' "How was that?" asked the sons of the Rajah. Vishnu-Sarman proceeded to relate:—

      "In South Behar, close by the retreat of Dhurmma, there was an open plot of ground, upon which a temple was in course of erection, under the management of a man of the Káyeth caste, named Subhadatta. A carpenter
      upon the works had partly sawed through a long beam of wood, and wedged it open, and was gone away, leaving the wedge fixed. Shortly afterwards a large herd of monkeys came frolicking that way, and one of their
      number, directed doubtless by the Angel of death, got astride the beam, and grasped the wedge, with his tail and lower parts dangling down between the pieces of the wood. Not content with this, in the mischief
      natural to monkeys, he began to tug at the wedge; till at last it yielded to a great effort and came out; when the wood closed upon him, and jammed him all fast. So perished the monkey, miserably crushed; and I say
      again— 'Let meddlers mark it, and be edified.' 'But surely,' argued Damanaka, 'servants are bound to watch the movements of their masters!' 'Let the prime minister do it, then,' answered Karataka; 'it is his
      business to overlook things, and subordinates shouldn't interfere in the department of their chief. You might get ass's thanks for it— 'The Ass that hee-hawed, when the dog should do it, For his lord's welfare,
      like an ass did rue it.' Damanaka asked how that happened, and Karataka related:—
