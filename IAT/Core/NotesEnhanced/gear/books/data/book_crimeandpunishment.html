      A ruble fifty. Take it or leave it. A ruble fifty? That's right, sweetheart. All right, all right. - Out the way! - But I'm cleaning, as you said. None of your lip, you, either. Interest is 10 percent a month. So
      on a ruble fifty, you owe me 15 kopecks. You also owe me 20 kopecks on the two rubles you had before. That comes to 35 kopecks. So what you get for your watch works out at a ruble 15. Here. I might bring you
      something else soon. A silver cigarette case. So you should expect me. - It's very good quality. - We'll see. Taken a shine to her, have you? Course not, gent like you. Give it back to me! Give me my licence back,
      please! It's my licence! Give it back! Come on, you tart! Where's this passport that you've got? I need it for work. Enough! That's enough! - Relax, it's a hooker. - Pimp. You think to behold a man... I behold him.
      I behold him when I see my Sonechka in these clothes!

      Well, don't worry, papa. She takes them off a lot. (ALL LAUGHING) You should know. Here, what are you doing? Trying to get a free one? Go home now and put this in her hand, and she'll love you all over again. What
      about your face powder and lipstick? I'll get some more money. Sir, can I ask a favour of you? I'd hate for anything to happen to him. - You want me to take him home? - He mustn't be detained. Where does he live?
      With my stepmother at Cazalsk tenements. Thank you. The little ones are hungry, Dad. Tell Katerina I'll fetch some more money tomorrow. Honest work, Sonia, one day. Honest work. You get home. Experience tells me,
      sir, that you are a man of education. I have trodden the path of better things, but now find myself stuck in a quagmire of destitution, swept out of human society with a broom. And now a fellow traveller takes me
      home, eh? - What do you mean? - Our fates, sir. Our fates. Make your own way home, you stupid old fool. But I'm scared, sir. I haven't been home for five days, sir. I lost my job and the jacket of my uniform.
      She'll hit me and the children will cry. But the main thing is I have someone I can go to and every man... Every man must have that. Don't you think? Somewhere he can go. (BABY CRYING) (COUGHING) I'm trying to keep
      you clean. I know I won't. Ow! Where's the money? Where is it? There are 12 silver rubles missing from my box. Where are they? Sir, Katerina Ivanovna, a person of education like yourself, a field officer's
      daughter. There's nothing in these pockets. And where's your uniform gone? She danced at the governor's graduation ball. They gave her a gold medal. - You dropped the money! - No! e dropped the money? He's spent
      the lot! All of it! Look at them! They haven't had anything to eat. They're going hungry while you're out... Why am I so cursed? What are you staring at? You should be ashamed of yourself. You're another one of
      them, aren't you?

      One of his drinking cronies. You're just another one of them. (COUGHING) LANDLADY: Been out looking for a job, by any chance? You could go back to giving lessons to children. What's the point? I'll get coppers.
      After a fortune all at once, are you? Yes. I'm after a fortune all at once. Me, I have much more modest ambitions. I just want the rent you owe me. Didn't hear you come home last night. My mother's praying for me
      and my sister is pawning herself in marriage for my sake. They should both get up off their bloody knees. Come on, you, eat this. Get your strength up. I should be in a dacha right now, out in the country. Cool
      air, plenty of room. I should have the means. Instead I'm stuck in this filthy, bloody city. This ant heap. Keep plugging away, eh? Sonia! Sonia! She bit my finger, Sonia. Look. - Oh, why? - So now I can't sew. So
      now I have nothing to sell. And if I can't earn money, then she'll hit me again. Come to my rooms tomorrow at 7:00. I'll have money for you. My sister will wonder where I am, where I've gone. You're coming to visit
      a friend. - Yes. - I shall read to you. My best friend. Lazarus. "And he that was dead came forth, "bound hand and foot with grave clothes." 7: 00 tomorrow. Your sister can look after herself for an hour, can't
      she? (BELL TOLLING) Come down for some soup? Um, no. I was, uh, just going out. What about you? I thought you'd be out seeing the neighbours. You usually are. Madam downstairs had other plans for me. - Um, do you
      know the time? - It's gone 7: 00. (BELL TOLLING) (SCREAMING) (MAN LAUGHING)

    <p>MAN: Ah, Nikolai, I'm thirsty. NIKOLAl: This is good work. MAN: You told me you were a craftsman. It's hard work. You don't think I'm going to pay you</p>
