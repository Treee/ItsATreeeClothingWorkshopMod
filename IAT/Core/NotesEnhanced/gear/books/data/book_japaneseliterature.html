      Methinks from the hedge round the garden His bride the fair hemp hath ta'en, And woven the fleecy raiment That ne'er he threw off him again. For toilsome the journey he journeyed To serve his liege and lord,[133]
      Till the single belt that encircled him Was changed to a thrice-wound cord; And now, methinks, he was faring Back home to the country-side, With thoughts all full of his father, Of his mother, and of his bride. But
      here 'mid the eastern mountains, Where the awful pass climbs their brow, He halts on his onward journey And builds him a dwelling low; And here he lies stark in his garments, Dishevelled his raven hair, And ne'er
      can he tell me his birthplace, Nor the name that he erst did bear.

      I stand by the grave where they buried The Maiden of Unáhi, Whom of old the rival champions Did woo so jealously. The grave should hand down through ages Her story for evermore, That men yet unborn might love her,
      And think on the days of yore. And so beside the causeway They piled up the bowlders high; Nor e'er till the clouds that o'ershadow us Shall vanish from the sky, May the pilgrim along the causeway Forget to turn
      aside, And mourn o'er the grave of the Maiden; And the village folk, beside, Ne'er cease from their bitter weeping, But cluster around her tomb; And the ages repeat her story, And bewail the Maiden's doom. Till at
      last e'en I stand gazing On the grave where she now lies low, And muse with unspeakable sadness On the old days long ago.

      The heaven and earth they call so great, For me are mickle small; The sun and moon they call so bright, For me ne'er shine at all. Are all men sad, or only I? And what have I obtained— What good the gift of mortal
      life, That prize so rarely gained,[138] If nought my chilly back protects But one thin grass-cloth coat, In tatters hanging like the weeds That on the billows float— If here in smoke-stained, darksome hut, Upon the
      bare cold ground, I make my wretched bed of straw, And hear the mournful sound— Hear how mine aged parents groan, And wife and children cry, Father and mother, children, wife, Huddling in misery— If in the
      rice-pan, nigh forgot, The spider hangs its nest,[139] And from the hearth no smoke goes up Where all is so unblest? And now, to make our wail more deep, That saying is proved true Of "snipping what was short
      before":— Here comes to claim his due,[233] The village provost, stick in hand He's shouting at the door;— And can such pain and grief be all Existence has in store? Stanza Shame and despair are mine from day to
      day; But, being no bird, I cannot fly away.

      The year has come, the year has gone again, And still no tidings of mine absent love! Through the long days of spring all heaven above And earth beneath, re-echo with my pain. In dark cocoon my mother's silk-worms
      dwell; Like them, a captive, through the livelong day Alone I sit and sigh my soul away, For ne'er to any I my love may tell. Like to the pine-trees I must stand and pine,[141] While downward slanting fall the
      shades of night, Till my long sleeve of purest snowy white, With showers of tears, is steeped in bitter brine.
