      Whylom, as olde stories tellen us, Ther was a duk that highte Theseus; Of Athenes he was lord and governour, And in his tyme swich a conquerour, That gretter was ther noon under the sonne. Ful many a riche contree
      hadde he wonne; What with his wisdom and his chivalrye, He conquered al the regne of Femenye, That whylom was y-cleped Scithia; And weddede the quene Ipolita, And broghte hir hoom with him in his contree With
      muchel glorie and greet solempnitee, And eek hir yonge suster Emelye. And thus with victorie and with melodye Lete I this noble duk to Athenes ryde, And al his hoost, in armes, him bisyde.

      And certes, if it nere to long to here, I wolde han told yow fully the manere, How wonnen was the regne of Femenye By Theseus, and by his chivalrye; And of the grete bataille for the nones Bitwixen Athenës and
      Amazones; And how asseged was Ipolita, The faire hardy quene of Scithia; And of the feste that was at hir weddinge, And of the tempest at hir hoom-cominge; But al that thing I moot as now forbere. I have, God woot,
      a large feeld to ere, And wayke been the oxen in my plough. The remenant of the tale is long y-nough. I wol nat letten eek noon of this route; Lat every felawe telle his tale aboute, And lat see now who shal the
      soper winne; And ther I lefte, I wol ageyn biginne.

      ‘What folk ben ye, that at myn hoom-cominge Perturben so my feste with cryinge?’ Quod Theseus, ‘have ye so greet envye Of myn honour, that thus compleyne and crye? Or who hath yow misboden, or offended? And telleth
      me if it may been amended; And why that ye ben clothed thus in blak?’ The eldest lady of hem alle spak, When she hadde swowned with a deedly chere, That it was routhe for to seen and here, And seyde: ‘Lord, to whom
      Fortune hath yiven Victorie, and as a conquerour to liven, Noght greveth us your glorie and your honour; But we biseken mercy and socour. Have mercy on our wo and our distresse. Som drope of pitee, thurgh thy
      gentillesse, Up-on us wrecched wommen lat thou falle. For certes, lord, ther nis noon of us alle, That she nath been a duchesse or a quene; Now be we caitifs, as it is wel sene: Thanked be Fortune, and hir false
      wheel, That noon estat assureth to be weel. And certes, lord, to abyden your presence, Here in the temple of the goddesse Clemence We han ben waytinge al this fourtenight; Now help us, lord, sith it is in thy
      might.

      I wrecche, which that wepe and waille thus, Was whylom wyf to king Capaneus, That starf at Thebes, cursed be that day! And alle we, that been in this array, And maken al this lamentacioun, We losten alle our
      housbondes at that toun, Whyl that the sege ther-aboute lay. And yet now the olde Creon, weylaway! That lord is now of Thebes the citee, Fulfild of ire and of iniquitee, He, for despyt, and for his tirannye, To do
      the dede bodyes vileinye, Of alle our lordes, whiche that ben slawe, Hath alle the bodyes on an heep y-drawe, And wol nat suffren hem, by noon assent, Neither to been y-buried nor y-brent, But maketh houndes ete
      hem in despyt.’ And with that word, with-outen more respyt, They fillen gruf, and cryden pitously, ‘Have on us wrecched wommen som mercy, And lat our sorwe sinken in thyn herte.’
