    <title>Navigation in the Apocalypse</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Being able to navigate effectively is a great skill for any walk of life and the more <br />
    you practice the more skilled you become. The most common items used to navigate are<br />
    a compass, a map and the sun. <br />
    <br />
    Compass <br />
    <p>
      Most compasses point North to magnetic north and show 360 degrees of angles.<br />
      This will be easier to follow with a compass on hand to look at as you read along.<br />
      The 4 cardinal directions are: <br />
      <br />
      North (0 degrees) <br />
      East (90 degrees)<br />
      South (180 degrees)<br />
      West (270 degrees)<br />
      <br />
      The acronym I was taught was Never Eat Soggy Wheetbix to remember the clockwise order <br />

      Every 45 degrees between those 4 are the commonly know:<br /><br />

      North East (45 degrees)<br />
      South East (135 degrees)<br />
      South West (225 degrees)<br />
      North West (315 degrees)<br /><br />

      Those 8 points can be expands to 16 by adding more every 22.5 degrees ( refer to book cover for reference ). <br />
      You can simply imagine another set of lines in between the 8 already there on the <br />circle if your compass does not show these. For example half way between North and North East is North North East, half way
      between North East and East is East North East, etc<br /><br />
      North North East (between 15 and 30 degree markers, 22.5 degrees)<br />
      East North East (between 60 and 75 degree markers, 67.5 degrees)<br />
      East South East (between 105 and 120 degree markers, 112.5 degrees)<br />
      South South East (between 150 and 165 degree markers, 157.5 degrees)<br />
      South South West (between 195 and 210 degree markers, 202.5 degrees)<br />
      West South West (between 240 and 255 degree markers, 247.5 degrees)<br />
      West North West (between 285 and 300 degree markers, 292.5 degrees)<br />
      North North West (between 330 and 345 degree markers. 337.5 degrees)<br /><br />
      While you can use degrees to communicate a direction it can be visually easier to see and<br />
      call out "North West" or "North North West" for a quick reference when under pressure,<br />
      like in an emergency, hunting situation, a fire fight, etc.<br />
    </p>
    The Sun
    <br />
    <p>
      The sun while not as precise as a compass but can be used to for navigation as it rises in the<br />
      East and sets in the West. Let's say you want to head North and the sun is rising in the East,<br />
      as long you keep the sun roughly 90 degrees to your right you will be travelling roughly North,<br />
      Sun is setting and you want to travel South keep the sun on your right and you will be travelling <br />
      roughly South. Remember Never Eat Soggy Wheetbix to help work out a direction using the sun. <br />
    </p>
    A Map
    <br />
    <p>
      A map is a wealth of knowledge packed with info and along with a compass, some skills and <br />
      experience you can effectively find your way around all sorts of terrain.<br />
      A map is set to a fixed scale for accuracy, the Deer Isle map scale is one grid square is equal<br />
      to 1km on the ground and if you look closer there are smaller squares which equal 100m's on the ground. <br />
      You will also notice a bunch of curved and squiggly lines all over the map, these are know as contour lines.<br />
      <br />
      Each line represents 1 meter in elevation change, so a bunch of tightly packed lines will mean a cliff edge, <br />
      a steep mountain slope or hole in the ground, very spaced out lines means a gentle rise or lowering of elevation, etc.<br />
      It's easy to get the hang of this by looking at your map and looking at the real world terrain feature<br />
      and see the correlation. It will get to a point where you can look at a map and know if a certain path or <br />
      terrain feature is accessible on foot just by the contour lines alone.<br /><br />
      You will notice across the top and sides of the map are numbers between every grid line,<br />
      if you combine a top and side number together for example 067 065 this is called a grid reference,<br />
      a 6 figure grid reference to be precise and you can use this as a reference point for any reason and it's<br />
      easy to communicate this to others also. <br />
      Move along the top of the map until you reach 067 then move down the side until you reach 065, <br />
      where these squares intersect is the location of the 6 figure grid reference.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The way I was taught to remember that the top or horizontal grids square is given first in a grid reference <br />
      is the monkey must run across the ground before it can climb a tree. Go across the map before you go up the<br />
      side with the numbers.<br /><br />
      Sometimes though a 100m grid square on the ground may contain a cliff edge, river, etc so greater navigational<br />
      accuracy is required and you may want to use an 8 figure grid reference. Basically as the 1km squares are<br />
      split into10 smaller 100m squares you then further break down the 100m squares to 10m squares.<br />
      To do this you take the top or side of the square and imagine the numbers 0 to 9 evenly spaced across the square,<br />
      0 being on the line itself, 5 being in the middle and 9 just before the start of the next grid square number.<br />
      Take the 067 065 example and find it on your map, if you look closely at the terrain and contour lines you will <br />
      notice it's a canyon river. <br />
      If you tried to come from the south and head north to this grid square you would come up to a sheer drop off as <br />
      shown by the contour lines, you would have to walk around 1km or more east or west to get around the canyon to reach the location. <br />
      An 8 figure grid reference can aid you in your navigational choices in getting to the location. <br />
      An easy way to estimate the last number without a ruler or similar is to estimate the half way point "5" <br />
      and adjust from there, or estimate the halfway point then estimate halfway between 5 and 0 for 2.5 or between 5 <br />
      and the next grind line for 7.5 and again adjust from there as needed. <br />
      <br />
      0675 0657 is located in the river itself, you may choose to travel down the river to reach this spot. <br />
      Half way along the 067 grid square gives us the "5" in 0675 and slightly above 3 quarters of the way down <br />
      the 065 square gives us the "7" in 0657. 0672 0652 is located in the north west of the grid square, you may <br />
      chose to get on the north side of the river before trying to reach this spot. Slight left of 1 quarter <br />
      across the 067 grid gives us the "2" in 0672 and slightly above 1 quarter down the 065 grid square gives us the "2" in 0652. <br />
      <br />

    Additional Thoughts
    <br />
    <p>
      Terrain features are a great visual aid to help navigate map to ground, for example a clearing in the woods,<br />
      a road (the map will show if it's a main sealed road, a sealed road or dirt road), hill, radio tower,<br />
      mountain, river, rocks, wells, train tracks etc can be used to locate your position without a gps type device. <br />
      From information you gathered with your eyes you can then look for those features on the map and<br />
      approximate the distances they are from you and use it to locate your position. Lets say you were blindfolded<br />
      and dumped somewhere in the 04 12 grid reference, a 1k by 1km square. You can see a main paved road <br /><br />
      running roughly north/south through the middle of the map, there's a town at the northern section of the square,<br />
      on the eastern side a wooded area on a hill with a radio tower to the south on top of the highest<br />
      point of the hill. On the western side of the grid square are some dirt roads, a bunch of varying size sheds,<br />
      some small sections of tree lines and in the north west corner is an ocean bay. If you can see any of <br />
      these features with your eyes you can use them to help determine your position. If you get lost don't panic! <br />
      Maps are know to have errors, don't be surprised if the satellite images on a map are out of date, it<br />
      might show trees and woods where there are now none, a fire could have ravaged the area since the images were<br />
      taken for example. It might be the opposite and a new large building has been built in the area and the<br />
      image show nothing there. Always confirm map to ground with your eyes.<br /><br />
