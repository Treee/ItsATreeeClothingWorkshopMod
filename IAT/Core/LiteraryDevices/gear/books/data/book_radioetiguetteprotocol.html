    1. PURPOSE: <br />
    <p>To provide communications personnel with Deer Isle tactics, techniques, and procedures (CGTTP) for using the radiotelephone</p>
    2. INTRODUCTION: <br />
    <p>This handbook gives general, unclassified radiotelephonetactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) for Deer Island use.</p>
    Radiotelephone is telecommunication by voice radio. It is one of the most common forms of communication between federal, state, and local authorities and the general public. The general public might not understand
    strict military procedures, so you might have to use international radiotelephone procedures when communicating with nonmilitary vessels or aircraft. <br />
    3. HOW TO CALL AND REPLY: <br />
    <p>
      Transmit and receive on voice circuits as follows (always keep proper circuit discipline in mind):<br /><br />
      1. Check transmitter/receiver settings and verify the proper frequencies are dialed in.<br />
      2. Listen carefully to the frequency to ensure no other transmissions are in progress. <br />
      3. Speak clearly in a normal tone of voice and hold the microphone about two inches from your mouth.<br />
      4. Avoid excessive calling and unofficial transmissions. Transmit call signs only once when radio conditions are favorable.<br />
      5. After three unsuccessful attempts to contact a station, transmit the proword NOTHING HEARD. <br />
      5a. Establish communications with another station and request assistance in contacting the original unit. <br />
      5b. Continue contact attempts at reasonable intervals.<br />
      6. Send transmissions at a speed that allows accurate message copying by the recipient. <br />
      6a. Transmit the message phrase-by-phrase, unkeying the microphone at regular intervals.<br />
      7. End every transmission with one of the following prowords:<br />
      OVER Recipient response required.<br />
      OUT No response required.
    </p>
    4. MESSAGE ELEMENTS: <br />
    <p>
      Transmit messages in the following order: <br />
      (CALL SIGN) - THIS IS (CALL SIGN) - (ANNOUNCETRAFFIC) - OVER <br />
      (CALL SIGN) - THIS IS (CALL SIGN) - OVER <br />
    </p>
    4.a. EXAMPLE: <br />
    <p>
      DEER ISLAND CONTROL, THIS IS RANGER ONE, I AM ENROUTE, OVER. <br />
      RANGER ONE, THIS IS DEER ISLAND CONTROL. ACKNOWLEDGED, CONTACT THIS UNIT WHEN YOU ARRIVE AT THE GATE. OUT.
