        Do you have questions about what is possible to craft with alchemy?<br />
        Come see Clayton at Camp Bellevue or at his southern outpost!<br /><br />
        "Briya Doro", this is the first saying you will need to figure out the recipe for one of the bandages.<br />
        To find other recipes for the same bandage you first find, <br />
        you will have to try the powdered herbs that work in each of the mortar bowl's crevices.<br />
        A solvant is used for other alchemy recipes.<br />
