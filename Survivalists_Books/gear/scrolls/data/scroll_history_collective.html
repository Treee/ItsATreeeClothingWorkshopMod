    <title>Recounting the Past</title>

    <p>
      Listen here, buddy. Maybe this isn't my business, but I feel like people start to forget the past of this island. Probably because so many died or fled before it escalated. Anyways, almost nobody remains from these
      times. So who is going to tell the story once the rest of us is gone? <br />

      I myself only know half of it. <br />

      When I arrived here I was extremely cautious, I won't lie. I pretty much shit my pants when I found a note with a weird symbol on a bulletin board near my home. I had no clue what the hell it was, so I gave it to
      someone who would ask around for me. <br />
      Turns out it was the symbol of the Collective! Yeah, and everyone said they had been bad guys who were forcefully taking blood samples from people and shit, for who knows what. But that Warlock, their leader, was
      supposedly not around anymore and that the note was probably old. <br />
      I started thinking I was seeing things, because I could have sworn that symbol wasn't there when I arrived here! <br />
      Anyways, a guy who I considered a friend back then (turns out he was an asshole) told me he was experimented on in a bunker and guess who had a talk with him at a big event? The supposedly dead Warlock! Yes! And it
      was him who did the experiments!<br />
      He told him he was looking for a cure and so on. Sounded pretty reasonable, but why did he have to be forceful about the whole thing? He could have just asked people for their blood nicely and for volunteers for
      his experiments and instead he was hated by many. <br />
      Well, a few weeks later I learned that Warlocks idea of a 'cure' was not what you would expect. Once his cure was finished, he invited a whole lot of people to witness it first hand and lead them inside the bunker.
      Once they were back, the whole island talked about what was down there. <br />
      Warlocks cure was the creation of mutants. <br />

      And they escaped the bunker. Or maybe they were set free. <br />

      Soon there was talk on the radio that they ate human meat. And that you needed to feed them, or they would feed on you instead. Everyone started to carry around food for them and a lot of people fled the island.
      <br />

      It's now 2006 and the mutants are everywhere. They even have their own group called S.T.A.R.S and live by the power plant in the radiation zone. Apparently now they have other things they can eat. I met one of them
      who told me that he does not touch human meat, so I guess most mutants have changed and the new ones don't even know what their ancestors were like. <br />

      I also met someone from back then by chance. He told me Duskar had gone to war against the mutants back then and almost all of Duskars people were tortured and killed, one by one, even the people just living there
      who didn't fight them. <br />

      Anyways, now you know. Do with it what you want<br />
