    <title>A Premonition of the Prophet Leviathan</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Leviathan lies resting within the depths of Jonah's soul, his rage slowly building. The lack of meth has weakened him to the point that he can barely hear <br />
      or speak. A light appears in the darkness of the void, drawing him to it like a moth to a flame. He thinks to himself: “this is new…” As he approaches the <br />
      light, it intensifies to the point of blinding him. Suddenly, he can hear whispers from all directions. Fearlessly he asks “who are you?” In unison they <br />
      reply, “We are many” He takes a step forward, the ground below his feet crunches with the familiar sound of deep snow. As his vision returns, he is <br />
      surrounded by the dead. They lumber and stand around ignoring him as though he were a ghost. At dusk, as the sun sets in the distance, he sees a huge <br />
      shadowy figure atop the hillside. The figure raises its hands and roars, The whispers become more frantic, intensifying until they turn into incoherent <br />
      screams. Leviathan shrieks, “I understand what you require, take me from this place.” The very last thing he hears is a whisper “sail North.“ Leviathan <br />
      comes to Jonah in a dream and slowly whispers: “Jonah. Hear me. Something stirs in a new land.. Build me a raft and gather supplies. This is a journey <br />
      meant for you and you alone and there isn’t a moment to spare.” Jonah ponders for a moment, pleading to Leviathan that he’s selected the wrong <br />
      individual for such a task. His name isn’t Noah, after all. His calls fall upon deaf ears; silence in his response. There was something <br />
      different about Levi’s tone, inflections unfamiliar to their conversations past. Could it possibly be…fear? Excitement? Anticipation?

    <p>
      Jonah begins cutting lumber and gathering resources. Crafting a raft of wood, and carefully binding each log to ensure sturdiness. <br />
      He takes his time. Leviathan watches, twiddling his thumbs in boredom as Jonah continues about his labors. <br />
      After a dream like delerium, the raft floats … hardly seaworthy. Jonah pushes the crude raft into the water, <br />
      and breathes a sigh of relief when it stays afloat. Levi speaks, “Well done, Jonah. It’s much easier when you <br />
      follow instructions, eh? Set your compass to North, we sail to the unknown. Jonah loads supplies and his beloved <br />
      M4 he calls Tigris. He sets his compass out next to the map and begins paddling north as night falls, looking for any help from the stars.

      As the sun’s last rays fade, Jonah asks Levi “What is this about?” Leviathan whispers, “They are speaking to me...the dead, <br />
      with voices hollow as graves dug hurriedly into the earth. They warn of a chill rising in the north. <br />
      We must investigate to bring back information, and also warn the others.” Jonah’s jaw falls open in surprise, <br />
      though it is too dark to be seen, not that anyone was there to see. “Wha…what ? You’ve only ever concerned <br />
      yourself with chaos and death, why care now? Why would you warn others of a threat rather than using knowledge <br />
      to your own advantage?” Again, silence. The sea turns minutes to hours, hours to days, days to weeks. <br />
      He drifts for eternity until a crack of lighting breaks the monotony of endless waves. Battered by crashing waves, <br />
      the raft no longer seems such a sturdy craft, as it slowly and deliberately breaks apart. <br />
      A wave rises high over the raft, and although Jonah scrambles to reach for his supply crate, <br />
      he is unable to grab it before it tilts precariously and plunges into the ocean. <br />
      Jonah recognizes the distinct sound of splitting wood as everything goes dark.

    <p>
      He's cold and alone, and snow is falling so thick he can barely see 10 feet in front of him. <br />
      It’s too cold to shiver, but he cannot shake the urge to fight to remain alert and at the ready. <br />
      Armed only with a Glock 19, he drops the mag and pulls back the slide, ensuring a round is chambered. <br />
      “One mag…great,” he murmurs to himself. He sees shadows of the dead in every direction and begins to panic. <br />
      Alone in a desolate place, utterly surrounded by wavering shadows that are moving and becoming more <br />
      clear with each thud of his heart. Weighing the risk, he takes aim and squeezes a round, nailing one in the head. <br />
      The bullet struck with an unfamiliar sound, almost as if hitting a rock. He thinks to himself, <br />
      “Fuck me sideways, they are frozen!” Jonah begins frantically firing as they surround him, <br />
      their chilly hands reaching and tearing at him. He feels cold teeth ripping his flesh as he fades into darkness. <br />
      He wakes suddenly, his head splitting. He’s freezing and clinging to what's left of the broken paddle. <br />
      He mutters “What the fuck was that?”. Levi speaks, “Get up, Jonah.” In his weakened state, starving, dehydrated, <br />
      and disoriented from his premonition, he musters the energy to stand. He rubs his eyes, but his vision remains blurred. <br />
      He only sees shadows through the fog and snow. “Where are we?” As he looks around, he sees mountains covered in snow and dotted with trees.. <br />
      In the distance stands a massive creature, fur pure white as snow. An inhuman roar is heard as the creature charges. <br />
      Jonah readies his weapon and everything goes dark, the visions melting away. Jonah awakens in a panic, screaming as he hears Levi’s <br />
      silky smooth voice whisper with an urgent hiss “Something is coming, Jonah. We must warn the island.”
