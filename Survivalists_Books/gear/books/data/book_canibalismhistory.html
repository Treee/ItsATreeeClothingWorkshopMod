    <title>Cannibal History of Deer Isle Past</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <br />
    <p>
      Nowadays, cannibalism is somewhat accepted, strangely enough. Both owing to the mutants and to a number of influential people who are and have been cannibals. <br />
      This was different in the past, however. Before the mutants, before the Arbiters even, there was the Coalition, and Jamestown, <br />
      both in the south in the same castle. We'll not be touching on their history in this book, aside from how it intersects with the Cannibals. <br />
      Now, having head the pleasure of talking with a number of people across the Isle that were here close to two years ago and further, <br />
      It's important to note cannibal activity was almost entirely centralized in the south at first, with a small number up north.<br />
      This is due to several factors, which we'll start with. Hello reader! This is the basis of knowledge on the Biomass and Mutant relationship that I've gathered so far. <br />
      It's the combination of research and information from multiple sources and me trying to put it together. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      First off, the population up north was rather small compared to the Southern survivors, a single town called Sanctuary <br />
      which shared it's land with the Riders of Portland, a few small bands of survivors, and a handful of loners. compared to the south, <br />
      which held around three to four towns with the largest being Jamestown, holding both the Coalition and Jamestown residents.<br />
      Secondly, there were many hiding places well known to the cannibals in the south, due to the outlook and actions taken against them back then. <br />
      Underground bunkers, Stoningtons sewer system leading to an underground school and military bunker, hidden caves. <br />
      Some cannibals even took a much riskier route and blended among townsfolk, acting as a normal person. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Easy access to both victims and hiding places made the south a Haven for cannibals, and yet at the same time it was the most dangerous.<br />
      Two to three years ago simply holding a piece of human meat was enough for towns and entire bands of survivors to hunt you or attack you.<br />
      It was a time of Paranoia, mistrust, and great violence. The heads of the cannibal hunters back then were the Coalition and Jamestown, <br />
      with the Coalition regularly hunting for cannibals and one man even reporting that it's leader had off-handedly mentioned drawing and quartering one. <br />
      To be accused of being a cannibal was to lose the trust of most of those around you, and possibly even be attacked by the Coalition. <br />
      This stemmed from how recently the Apocalypse had been, and due to influential figures in several groups having secretly been cannibals <br />
      before being outted. Along with old world morals still holding true in everyone's hearts. While Jamestown and the Coalition hunted these cannibals,<br />
      a great many tragedies occurred due to how zealous they could be. People were attacked simply over suspicion, and a number hurt badly or ostracized <br />
      due to devious and otherwise immoral people slipping human meat into their bags and belongings, so that they could frame the innocents for cannibalism. <br />
      Though there were many losses due to actual cannibals too.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      An infamous cannibal by the Name of Jester existed, I could not get much information on him, aside from the fact that he existed, <br />
      and according to a comment made by the leader of the Coalition Jester had over twenty five confirmed victims! He was eventually caught <br />
      and executed through cooperation between a town by the name of Blackstone, the Coalition, and Jamestown. This was very much the beginning <br />
      of a hidden decline in cannibal activity in the south. More and more people had begun moving North after Jester's execution, due to issues<br />
      held with the Coalition and Jamestown, and also just for better conditions as the North held many locations not yet picked over by scavengers.<br />
      With this migration many cannibals went as well, I do not have many records of their activity during this time, or in general. <br />
      As they were a people in hiding of sorts, split apart and fragmented. Though apparently there was a sort of small civil war between<br />
      two cannibal gangs in the far north according to a few people I've interviewed on it. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a brief return to the South, where a band of Cannibals lead by someone who had left Jamestown over disagreement with it's leadership, <br />
      and the two leaders of Jamestown accused each side of being cannibals. Not much actually resulted of this, but as it turns out the Leadership <br />
      of Jamestown were indeed cannibals, discovered much later by the majority of the island, and believed by a few the entire time. <br />
      The town itself was not, only the leaders. Eventually, cannibals slowly began to become more mainstream, both as charismatic figures were <br />
      revealed to be cannibals and old world morals began to fall to the road, tossed aside for survival, practicality, and in some cases just plain <br />
      lack of moral and reason. Either way, in the end it slowly became more common and acceptable over time not widely accepted publicly but known<br />
      cannibals were tolerated and treated well as long as they kept their activities private and did not harm people's friends and allies. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually the mutants came along, people who'd taken a Serum and now were left with a choice. Eat human or mutant meat, or live off of radiation. <br />
      Believe it or not this actually set back cannibalisms mainstream entry quite a lot, with most now being distrusted and anti mutant sentiments <br />
      at first remaining relatively low for a time, and then after the events of sandy bay began to truly rise as well. <br />
      Anti Cannibal sentiment rose greatly among this, but never as high as it was in those olden days a few years ago. <br />
      Currently, cannibals are not actively hunted by most, and are even accepted in a number of locations. <br />
      Mutants themselves, if something I was told by a man who overheard a few of those in S.T.A.R speaking, have other options as well. <br />
      The Coalition is long dead, and cannibals can be found all across the isle, quietly tolerated and even treated well in several locations, <br />
      as long as they don't do it publicly or advertise it to everyone they come across. Though mutants are given a free pass<br />
      in public company from what this researcher has seen. Though I believe anti cannibal sentiment is on the rise again in most places, <br />
      and in this researchers firm belief that is a good thing. Not only does it lead to disease, but there's only so much edible dead human laying around, <br />
      it's only a matter of time before they'd have to look at the living to fulfill their cravings.<br />
