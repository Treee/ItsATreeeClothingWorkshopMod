      A Knight requires many traits, cunning, courage, vigor, intellect and of course charm. Such are these requirements that potential gentlemen must demonstrate their aptitude, performing many feats to arise in the
      Guild. The first step requires one to be good with their hands, the hopeful gentlemen should be able to craft the following.
    </p>
    <p>Hopeful</p>
    <p>
      A fire and improvised fire starter.<br />
      Bone knives and hooks using remains from a slain animal. <br />
      An improvised torch, for some, warmth on the move is a necessity. <br />
      An improvised fishing rod. Give a man a fish…<br />
      These tasks may be performed with nothing more than a knife and the remains of an animal. For it is only right that a life slain should help others to go on. <br />
      Once demonstrated you shall be granted the title “hopeful”<br />
      The next set of tasks require a degree of intelligence, for the hopeful shall expand their skills.<br />
      Demonstrating the following, shall provide insight into life in the far wilderness, away from the ease of cities. <br />
    </p>
    <p>Intelligent</p>
    <p>
      You have performed the feat of arson, keeping warmth to your body, though what good is that without a dry place to sleep and clothes to keep you warm. For a knight shall not always have a curvaceous companion to
      share warmth with. As such the following must be demonstrated. <br />
      Sewing of fine leather clothes, resistant to water and cold. A spot of gardening perhaps?<br />
      Construction of a temporary shelter. A fine plot of land will do.<br />
      A good source of ammo are bolts fired from a bow, using your intellect, fashion some bolts then apply feathers to them.<br />
      Sometimes the silent way just won’t do, perhaps a spear to liven things up<br />
    </p>
    <p>Brave</p>
    <p>
      So, you have mastered the art of being warm and dry, now it is time to practice, this task will require some intelligence and cunning for bears are dangerous when agitated. <br />
      Locate and slay a Bear, bring the pelts for observation, only the finest shall do. <br />
    </p>
    <p>Knight</p>
    <p>
      You have demonstrated many traits, the last task you must complete is not to be underestimated, using your newly learned skills you must fashion a coat truly warm enough for the most inhospitable conditions while
      using the thickest of pelts. Once completed make your way to the north, construct a raft and sail for colder shores, once there, secure your raft and scout for the Knights Guild. Speak With Sir Thomas Knight and
      claim your reward.
