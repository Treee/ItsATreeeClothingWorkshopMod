    <p>The Arbitration isn’t just a faction, it’s an idea” - Anonymous.</p>
    <p>
      Many people have heard the phrase, “Glory to the Arbitration” but do we truly understand it? I intend to learn the meaning behind it and in doing so learn more about the mysterious cult that has been plaguing the
      Isle for years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst exploring the Isle and asking about this mysterious group. I have been getting lots of mixed stories about them. Some say that they are “Nothing but common bandits” whilst others I have spoken to have said
      that “When they first arrived on the Island, they gave them gear and showed them the best places to settle down on the Isle”.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had a sit down with one of the Leaders. Anton. I asked him to describe what the arbitration’s goals were and he said “Our main goals were to spread the belief of Statera (Balance). The new world needed
      balance and we were the ones to uphold it”. To me, these values were questionable. Who gives them the right to dictate when they become good or bad, that’s just my professional opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Arbiters were first founded by Gaunt & Anton after they left New Haven, tired of the cannibal group and ghosts terrorizing the island. However, the first people they recruited were unreliable at best, causing
      more harm than good, resulting in them disbanding the faction and joining Bastion, which at the time was also trying to fight the Ghosts as well. During the decline of the Ghosts, they hosted a battle royale-type
      event that would hold the fate of their home, Purgatory. Gaunt took part and slaughtered all but one of the contestants at the battle. Following the victory, all the Ghosts committed suicide except one, allowing
      Gaunt to inflict the final blow and ending the reign of the Ghosts. After winning Purgatory, Gaunt, Anton, Tank and a few others decided to reform the Arbitration, so they left Bastion. Owning Purgatory, the
      Arbiter's morality quickly spiralled downhill. Cannibalism, Banditry, and Ritualistic Practices become more of their thing whilst extending their grasp over the island.

      Warlock would unveil the first generation of Alpha Mutants. All were incredibly violent and saw humans as pets at best, and prey at worst. Following this development, the Arbitration would begin anti-warlock
      actions as several friends of theirs suffered at Warlock’s hands. Bastion would enter the bunker with the arbiters, Skylar from the Salty Cougar Tavern, Graylite the Alpha Mutant & Alex McKnight in hopes of
      confronting Warlock and discovering his plans for the island. The arbiters would hold Warlock up and begin interrogating him, who admitted he planned to connect everyone to the collective hivemind and turn as many
      people into mutants as possible. Rumours suggest that the Arbiters also stole Warlock’s robes, but I couldn’t prove this.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attacks on settlements and factions like Lamplight (A group dedicated to the extermination of the Alpha Mutant threat). This led to an alliance with Lamplight in hopes of working together to take down the
      Warlock threat. The three groups, Arbiters, Lamplight and Bastion pursued their methods of dealing with the mutant threat. Warlock would eventually leave the bunker once more, this time handing out his mutant serum
      in hopes of turning the people of Deer Isle into hybrid mutants. The exact numbers on how many people took the serum, however, I was given three names by an anonymous source. Harold of Bastion, Rory of Burleeville
      & Alex McKnight. Harold and Alex McKnight turned so Lamplight could study them in hopes of developing a weapon or at least a cure.

      Eventually, after several outings of Dr. Carr, the information from an observer and information given by Drake of the Black Palm, all of which were given to Harold. The observer told Harold that Warlock was making
      something to spread Biozones, Drake said that it was around the Northeastern region of the island starting from Sandy Bay that it would happen. This was brought to multiple parties and preparation for the battle to
      begin. Skylar had begun preparing for it ages before without actually warning anybody herself. The battle of Sandy Bay would begin and last over two days. The arbiters did not participate in the first day, where
      the resisting people gathered at the Last Stand, they lost Sandy Bay to the Alphas mutants. The arbiters would turn up on the second day to help fight the alphas in Sandy Bay for a while before leaving to “Respond
      to Alphas in oilfield”. The battle for Sandy Bay was lost and the second flower of the island was planted there. Following the loss, the arbiters announced their distaste for all mutants, and it became believed
      they intended to kill them all.

      There are many speculations on why the Arbiters helped up the town of Sanctuary and assassinated their mayor, Ron Swanson. However, speaking with Anton, led me to conclude that the reason this tragic event happened
      was because Sanctuary killed the leader of the Pathfinders, Rascal. The arbiters wanted an eye for an eye, and they got it. Following the execution of the beloved mayor, Sanctuary became a ghost town. Many of its
      formal residences banded together and created a new settlement, Salvation. However, they never forgive the Arbiters.
    </p>
    <p>
      From what I have learnt from the conversations with numerous known Arbiters. The leadership of the faction is spread between Gaunt & Anton, however when I asked who the current Inquisitors are. They refused to
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many people were upset to see Graylite, the first Sentient Alpha Mutant get killed by both the Arbitration and Star, but witnesses report it was the Arbiters, Teddy & Ben Kerry that shot first at Alpha Mutant.
      Witnesses report that Teddy screamed “Death to Gray”
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we talk about recent history. The raid and sacking of the Pantheon. Many including myself consider this the end of the Arbitration. Their holy grounds were desecrated, and Their coffers cleared out. Nothing
      Left.
