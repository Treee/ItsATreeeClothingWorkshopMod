      So, you’ve been shot, stabbed, scratched, fallen on a fork, etc. I bet you’re thinking ‘Holy shit that hurts I wish my blood would stay inside’ Well, we’re gonna teach you that nice and easy. First, Identify the
      Injury! Not all wounds are the same, and you can be in serious trouble if you don’t treat them properly! While Identifying the injury, take the time to see if it’s cut or pierced an Artery or vein, if it has please
      refer to the section on Arterial Bleeds. Scratches are the easiest, you can typically just bandage them, though I always advise to try a bit of disinfectant beforehand. Who knows where that hand or rusty piece of
      metal has been? You could get Tetanus! Stab wounds can be bad depending on where they are, if you get stabbed in the liver for example, you’re gonna need a doctor. However in general the most you can do at the time
      is Identify the site, and bandage it. For Bites from animals, cuts from jagged metal, and other injuries from dirty sources, always remember disinfectant is your best friend! Pour it over the injury and clean it
      out before bandaging it with a clean bandage preferably.
    </p>
    <p>
      For gunshot wounds, it’s pretty obvious you’ve been shot, but what you need to do after is identify if the Bullet passed through or is still stuck in you, as leaving that in for too long will lead to blood
      poisoning, infection, nasty stuff. If it’s passed through you and out the other side, you can use bandages, rags, or stitches, otherwise called sutures, to stop the bleeding. You should see a medical professional
      later to see if there’s any internal injuries. If you use dirty rags, or stitch it together make sure to use disinfectant. In a pinch a sewing kit needle and thread are actually pretty decent stitching tools. If
      the bullet didn’t pass through, you’re in for a bit of pain. First things first you’ll need to find out where the bullet is. This is usually pretty easy to get a rough idea on, as it’ll typically hurt like hell and
      shift while you move. If it’s near a vital organ or artery/vein, I advise to simply bandage the wound, bind the area tightly, and move as carefully as possible to a medical professional. If not, you can do this
      yourself with a decent amount of pain. You’ll need Pliers, Tweezers, or a Knife. I advise Tweezers typically. Make sure to clean and disinfect the item you’re using, so as to prevent getting yourself sick. If you
      have Painkillers using them is advised as jerking due to pain can cause serious damage. Using the item in question, carefully use it on the injury site to remove the bullet, as many pieces as you can. I still
      advise seeking a medical professional after this, or for the entirety of it as bullets can fragment inside of you. Which means they leave tiny bits in your body that poison you. After the main bullet piece is gone,
      apply bandages. Seek doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Lacerations and otherwise massive cuts and gashes, you’re going to want to clean it quickly and carefully, and then suture the injury shut. After that, apply bandages to keep it clean and replace them
      regularly, make sure to watch the stitches to ensure there’s no infection. For Shrapnel from Grenades or other explosions, you’ll want to identify entry points and where the shrapnel is. You can follow the method
      for removing bullets with shrapnel, but you must be more careful, as it’s often jagged and much more oddly shaped then bullets and their fragments, so it can do much more damage to you while removing it. Definitely
      see a medical professional after this.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the event of Arterial bleeding, you’ll need to immediately identify which it is, and apply a Tourniquet as quickly as possible to the limb itself to stop blood flow. If it’s in the torso somehow, you’ll need to
      apply enough pressure to cut off blood flow to the Artery somehow. IMMEDIATELY seek professional aid, no lollygagging. These are temporary solutions at best and you will die if untreated. You may ask why I advise
      to see a Doctor so often, simply put it’s because often people don’t correctly treat their injuries or leave small fragments from bullets inside them. This can cause serious health issues later. Another commonality
      is someone getting shot six times and then getting up and running around the next day. I cannot stress how bad that is for your long term health, if you are severely injured take it easy. Walk, don’t carry heavy
      burdens, light work. If you have no choice you have no choice, but if you have the choice, take the time to rest.
    </p>
    <p>Medicine!</p>
    <p>
      So you wanna identify your Medicines? Well some will be beyond you but we’ll go over the basics. Bandages, Rags, And Sewing Kits: Not medicine per se but these all have the medical use of stopping bleeding.
      Bandages are the best, rags the second best if clean, and Sewing kits are good for suturing in an emergency. Disinfect the injury site directly after stitching it however.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antibiotics: There are several kinds on the Island, and they can roughly be used for the same thing. These Antibiotics are Macropen, which comes in containers of up to sixteen tablets, Amoxicillin, which can come
      in bottles of fourteen tablets, and Tetracycline, the most common one to find. It can come in packages of 12. While their effectiveness seems to differ, I’d always advise to go with Tetracycline where possible.
    </p>
    <p>Disinfectants: There are quite a few different kinds of disinfectant on the island. You only need one however, and the use for these is to disinfect injuries, wound infections, and clean other medical items.</p>
    <p>
      Blood Bags and Saline Bags: These are mostly for the purpose of replenishing your blood, but do it in separate ways. Saline Bags will rehydrate you and encourage your body to produce more blood. Where-as with blood
      bags you must fill it with blood of a type compatible with your own, (preferably filling it with your own in advance.) And then attach an IV kit to it, both require IV kits, and both must be disinfected before you
      apply the IV to yourself, the blood bag must be disinfected before you fill it with your own blood too.
    </p>
    <p>Iv Start Kits: You attach these to Saline and Blood bags so that you can feed them into your body via Intravenous Drip.</p>
    <p>
      Painkillers: Morphine, Codeine, the such. Painkillers will dull or even temporarily eliminate pain, letting you walk on broken legs. Move when heavily injured, and fight through wounds that would normally knock you
      out from the pain. Morphine is injected via an Auto injector and works much faster than pills.
    </p>
    <p>Vitamins: Always good to have since they can, depending on the vitamins can help make up for certain nutrients you don’t get with your current diet, and help boost your immune system.</p>
    <p>
      Epinephrine: You might call it an Adrenaline shot, if someone is having a heart attack, their heart stopping, or the such you inject them with this. It’s not a proper medical treatment per se but it will keep them
      alive longer so that you can get them treated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stim Packs: Now, I don’t know everything about these. I’ve had the good luck to get my hands on a few STAG Stimpacks once, as well as use several crude ones, but what StimPacks do is increase your healing rate to
      the point that you rapidly heal. Each Company supposedly has their own Stimpacks and they seem to interact differently with the human body. The Stag stimpack actually isn’t that great for your health, but it can
      heal broken limbs and get you moving again, where-as the crude ones we produce on Island can induce rapid healing. A stimpack is always a good choice to have as it can be the difference between life and death if
      you sustain serious injuries. I’ve not had the chance to see Espen or L&S Stimpacks in action or hear about how they interact truly, so I cannot speak on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      PO-X Antidotes: I don’t understand too much about these, but simply put these are for Radiation. You get stuck in a biozone with a breached suit or breathe in some spores? Get out and pop this bad boy. It’ll save
      your life and make recovering much easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medical Kit: You know your medicine, now let’s talk about a medical kit! Carrying a kit of personal medical supplies is important, as it’ll save your life, your friends life, and strangers lives. You should always
      have at least some, now a good medical kit can handle almost any situation, so what you’ll typically want in one is: <br />
      Four Bandages <br />
      One Bottle of Disinfectant<br />
      One pill case of Antibiotics of any kind,<br />
      One Pill Case of Charcoal Tablets<br />
      One Autoinjector of Morphine (Codeine can replace it but is slower acting)<br />
      One Epinephrine Auto Injector<br />
      One Iv Start Kit<br />
      One blood bag or one saline bag<br />
      Optionally one Stim Pack for emergency,<br />
      Optionally one PO-X Antidote if going near Radioactive Zones.<br />

      A kit with these items can handle almost any situation you find yourself in. The Optional items will increase your versatility to handle injury or sickness.,
    </p>
    <p>Disease!</p>
    <p>There are a few common diseases that show up on the isle, so we’re gonna go over them and how to avoid, identify, and treat them!</p>
    <p>
      Salmonella:Typically, this is what happens when you eat uncooked meat, and rotten food on the island. It’ll result in you vomiting up whatever you try to eat, and sometimes even what you drink. The easiest way to
      avoid this? Cook your damn food, and don’t eat the rotten stuff. It still can be found in your fellow survivors somewhat commonly, so how do you help fix your friends' agony? Simple, Charcoal Tablets..
    </p>
    <p>
      Cholera: Another easily avoided disease that people somehow manage to get commonly, the symptoms are also puking for this, but the source is different. It’s unpurified water. From rivers, ponds, lakes, random water
      bottles you found on the side of the road. Don’t drink it if you can’t clean it! Find a well. The Treatment for this happens to be Antibiotics, Tetracycline, Amoxicillin, and Macropen should all work with varying
      degrees of effectiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colds: Not really a serious disease, but it can seriously bring you down. It’s also a bit harder to tell as it shares most of the easily visible symptoms it has with Influenza, better known as The Flu. Easy enough
      to get, stay cold long enough, in water long enough and you’ll likely end up with it. Other people sick with it can also spread it if they sneeze on you. Always wear a mask. Treatment for this, also happens to be
      Antibiotics. Cough syrup can help with the coughing if you have any.
    </p>
    <p>
      Influenza: Also caused by being cold or exposed to water too much, the symptoms for this are Coughing, Sneezing, and Typically fever. This can also be caught from other people sick with it, the treatment is
      surprise surprise, ALSO ANTIBIOTICS, seriously carry some pills of antibiotics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wound Infection: You got cut and didn’t disinfect it or clean it properly? Well now you have an infection and it wants you dead. You’ll find your vision blurring with this, along with random spikes of pain. The
      only real solution is to apply disinfectant to the wounded site until clean, and then routinely take antibiotic doses until the infection clears out. Make sure any shrapnel, bullet fragments, or bits of claw that
      might be stuck in you have been removed as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Radiation poisoning: So you walked into a zone without a suit, or something breached your suit, or maybe your filter ran out? Well either way you’re dying. Luckily, you can resolve this, a PO-X Antidote will clear
      up a large amount of the poison, and replacing your blood with non irradiated blood can help clear up further symptoms. Make sure to clean yourself and your clothing as well, as spores from the Flowers can linger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kuru: You ate a person, you sick fuck. Anyways, I’m putting this here as sometimes people like to disguise human meat as normal meat, or force folk at gunpoint to eat it. It’s a brain prion disease, you’re going to
      die. That is, unless of course you find someone with a vial of Kuru Cure, and experimental treatment that can clear it up. Noticeable symptoms are twitching, constant laughter, irrational actions and sometimes
      insanity.
