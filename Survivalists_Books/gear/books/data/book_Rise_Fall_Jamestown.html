    <title>The Rise and Fall of Jamestown</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <br />

      Jamestown was established roughly 3 months after the outbreak. It was founded by two men, Robert Matthews and Arlen Pike. Robert, a strange yet extravagant man was seen as the Mayor of the town, whilst Arlen ran
      the day to day tasks, like moving in the residents and ensuring people followed the rules. As Well as collecting the weekly rent. The town was originally set up in a small campsite which, before the outbreak, was
      used by the local boy scouts troop and large corporations for “team building” outings and weekends away.

      Jamestown was seen by many as the first successful new world town on Deer Isle, paving the way for many towns to follow shortly after. As the weeks went by Jamestown gradually began to fill up, almost becoming a
      social hub of the island, allowing a place for traders and survivors to come and barter, socialise and rest. It wasn’t the largest of areas but many people were glad to call it their home.

      It wasn’t long until small outfits of bandits heard about the town's success and made it their primary target. It was only a few weeks of being up and running until the bandits came knocking on the doors of
      Jamestown. Whilst no shots were fired, it was by no means a peaceful introduction. Arlen, Robert and the leader of this unknown bandit group had a private meeting in their town hall. Noone knows for sure what was
      discussed in the meeting, but it was quite commonly assumed that the leaders of Jamestown offered to pay these bandits in food and supplies on a monthly basis for the bandits to leave the town alone.

      A few days later more trouble started brewing as a fight broke out between two drunkards by the town's gateway. Arlen stepped in to intervene but was quickly knocked aside by a stray elbow and fell to the floor
      with a broken nose and a black eye. Both the drunks drew their guns on eachother. It wasn’t long until the townsfolk rallied behind Robert and forced both the drunkards out of the town. They were stripped of their
      residency and banished from the town for good. It was on this day that Robert and Arlen made the decision to start the Jamestown Militia. This Militia was led by a young man named Artem. The Militia was tasked with
      protecting the town and keeping the peace. Ensuring that the residents and guests follow the laws of the town, and those who start trouble were to be quickly removed.

      After running the town for a few months, Arlen and Robert decided that it was time to enact the final part of their mission. To bring back democracy to the island. WIth their town gaining some traction and it
      starting to fill up, it was time for the residents to elect a new Mayor of Jamestown. With a week of speeches and campaigns, people led up, one by one, to let Robert and Arlen know their final decision. A resident
      named Shaun won by a landslide, by 13 votes. The following day, Robert and Arlen packed their things and moved out of the town, making way for Shaun to take control.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Things went well with Shaun as the Mayor, people liked him and things didn’t change much. It wasn’t until he decided to step down and pass leadership of to a woman named Louella that things began to change.
      Louella's first move as Mayor of Jamestown was, because of the recent increase in banditry around the island, to move Jamestown up into the hills, in an abandoned castle which was only accessible by a single
      bridge. Louella managed to rally up the residents, and over the following few days they had moved all of their crucial belongings and set up camp in the abandoned castle, leaving the old scouts camp completely
      abandoned. It took the town a few weeks to rebuild and recuperate from the move, but it all seemed worth it. The castle was relatively intact and structurally it was sound. The single point of entry made the
      Millitas job easier, as they were able to monitor everyone who entered, and the residents felt safer in the towering walls of the ruin.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Over the coming months residents came and went, some of the longer standing residents even set up a small trading post out of one of the ruined shacks in the castle's courtyard. All was well in Jamestown. Until the
      bandits turned up once more. They came demanding the supplies that they were owed for that month. Louella knew about this agreement, but decided to ignore their warning, shutting down the deal. Jamestown was much
      stronger now, and it’s defences had significantly improved. They did not need to be bullied by this small outfit of misfits anymore. This decision was, as expected, not taken lightly. The bandits left the meeting
      and returned later that evening with greater numbers. They were attempting to lay siege to the town.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The cracking of gunfire and screams of wounded survivors went on through the entire night. Both sides suffered from heavy casualties, but Jamestown remained unpenetrated. The bandits had failed to breach the walls.
      But this would not deter them from trying again, and again. Jamestown was under constant fire from bandits, cannibals and any scum who roamed the island, yet no-one seemed able to conquer this fortress. From the
      outside, it was impenetrable. But on the inside, panic began to spread among the residents. They had closed their off walls to the outside and food supplies were thin. Most residents were scared to leave the walls
      of the castle, fearing the bandits who could be lurking outside along the roads. It was this that led to Louella recruiting the Coalition, commanded by a man named Zevor, to help fight alongside the Militia.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>This was, as considered by many, the decision that led to the fall of Jamestown.</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The Coalition were aggressive and power hungry. Upon moving into the castle they claimed 1/3rd of it’s grounds to be used for combat drills and storing their equipment. Whilst this space was unused for the time
      being, it prevented the town from expanding. The new guards, as instituted by Zevor, were continuously harassing the residents. At times they would hold residents at gunpoint demanding to search their belongings.
      Which often led to some of these belongings going missing shortly after. This behaviour went on for months without any repercussion and the residents began to feel unsafe inside their own walls… One by one, they
      slowly vacated their homes and went back out onto the isle in search of a new start.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      This slow bleed of residents continued to happen for weeks until all that was remaining inside of Jamestown was a few remnants of the Militia, a few loyal residents and Louella herself. The Coalition had dwindled
      down to a small handful of members and Jamestown was just a shell of what it once was.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Jamestown achieved many feats. It proved that not only could communities exist on Deer Isle, but that they could thrive! It showed the island that a town of like minded individuals, regardless of military training
      and arms, could defend themselves for days on end. But this is not what it will be remembered for, if it is even remembered at all.
