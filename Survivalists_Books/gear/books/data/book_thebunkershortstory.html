    The Bunker<br />
    A Short Story Comic<br />
    by PiGLeT, written down By Skylar Wolfe
    <p>Skylar Wolfe PiGs Mom, looked at the viral Serum in her hands and feelin very Sick.</p>
    <p>
      She walked over to dis window and reflected on her Treasured surroundings. She had always hated The Bunker with its ugly, unlucky Underground tunnels. <br />
      It was a place that encouraged her tendency to get lost. How dis Getin Lost? PiG I can't put that in the story. Sighs. Ok this is Your story i will write all the things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Warlock. Thats PiG's Father!!! Warlock was a tyrant Mutant Scientist<br />
      with glowing eyes Claws and mutated S
    </p>
    <p>
      Skylar gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a frail, trusting, Fanta drinker with Smooth skin and a love of weed. Her friends saw her as a mangled,<br />
      magnificent Mutant mother. Once, she had even helped a Baby Stalker cross the road. Was that Me Mom? Asked PiG. I don't know PiG, do you want it to be you? Yes.
    </p>
    <p>But not even a person who had once helped a Baby Stalker cross the road, was prepared for what Warlock had in store today.</p>
    <p>The snow flurried like rampaging Bears, making Skylar feel enhanced and also cold. Mom scared of all bears? Yes PiG.</p>
    <p>As Skylar stepped outside and Warlock came closer, she could see the sleepy glint in his eye.</p>
    <p>
      "I am here because I want the Medical report," Warlock bellowed, in a wholesome tone. He slammed his fist against Skylar's chest, with the force of 1828 Crabs.<br />
      "I frigging love you, Skylar Wolfe." I like that way of the story best said PiG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Skylar looked at Warlock, even more enhanced and still holding the viral Serum. "Warlock, your lust for power has destroyed you," she replied. Not exactly what I said, <br />
      but this is your story PiG.
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other with Contaminated feelings, like two wonky, wet Wolves hiding at a very boring funeral of fathers death, which had guitar music playing in<br />
      the background and two mother uncles evolving slowly to the beat of the musics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, Warlock lunged forward and tried to punch Skylar in the face. Quickly, Skylar grabbed the viral Serum and brought it down on Warlock's skull. Oh! Mom,<br />
      Mom...You remember when we did the Bunker fights? PiG, I gotta finish this story for you concentrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Warlock's glowing eyes trembled and his mutated Skin wobbled. He looked infected, his body raw like a bumpy, bloody pizza. Does PiG love pizza? I don't think you've had<br />
      pizza PiG, its a hot melted bread with cheese. Oh. Said PiG. I can put acid in it to melt it. PiG Focus please. Said Skylar.
    </p>
    <p>Then Warlock let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Warlock was dead, again.</p>
    <p>Skylar Wolfe went back inside and made herself a nice drink of Fanta and Beer. Oh! Also Pizza.</p>
    <p>I wish I had pizza.</p>
    <p>THE END</p>
