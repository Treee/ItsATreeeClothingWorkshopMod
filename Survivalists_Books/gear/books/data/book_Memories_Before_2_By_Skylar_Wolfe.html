    <p>I have found writing down my memories as I remember them is quite calming. I don't know who will come across these journals and books, none the less I will continue to write as I enjoy the calm it brings me.</p>
    <p>Who am I? That is a question I frequently ask myself. I have been called many things over time. I think I will challenge myself to think back as far as I can remember and start there and see where I end up.</p>

      Nana is my first memory, it's faded as I can only really remember when I was about 8 years old, and it's faded now. Cheeky little thing. That was her favorite. I remember clashing a lot with her, she was a
      no-bullshit type, in your face and brutally forward. " Skylar Wolfe!! " She'd yell at me when I fucked up. " How hard is it to use your common sense? " Ha, Then Papa would chime in. " Eh, now don't be an asshole" I
      knew they loved me and I them. When she passed the last thing she said to me was "Use your common sense and don't be an asshole." those words have stayed with me to this very day. Scatterbrain.

      On my uncle's research vessel before the breakout and before the world fell into chaos. Tasked with helping researchers and medics alike, I hated it, but, it proved seriously useful when the world fell. Stoner
      Girl. Okay yes. Yes, I am. That won't change. Freak.

      A little harsh. People often villanise what they can't be a part of or understand. Suppose it's easier to just attack the unknown rather than explore it and learn from it. Monster. O.0 I like to see it as a
      transformation of self. What most don't even bother asking me is why did I do it. Heh. Why did I take on the mutations that looked so monster-like? It was to protect my children, and I say children more of a name
      holder. I adopted them, took them out of a bad place, and tried to teach them to protect. People never tried to understand, and they were slaughtered by ignorance and bloodlust, now their husks wander and are much
      like the undead, mindless killing meat sacks. It's a pity. Alpha Dark Queen. This one took me by surprise if I'm being honest with myself, Queen. Yeah right. Can I control the Pure Alphas and summon them to my aid?
      Yes. I don't know exactly how, something in my blood, an anomaly, or some outlandish shit I don't understand. What I do know is I used the ability to kill Warlock. Ugh, Let's not go down that rabbit hole. Musician.
      This one I like. That was my dream, grow some weed, find a cat. I play my guitar. Raise goats. Hmm, By a small river, do some fishing. Man, did that ever NOT happen. I do have the cat.

      Halo. My cat. A skittish little shit has been following me since almost day one. Small stripy girl. Good mouser. I love just singing to her. Playing my guitar. Halo even helps me find used strings and scampers
      about as I loot the apartments for old guitars and songbooks. I found a run-down but still working cassette player and some blank tapes. Did some recordings and left a couple at the old radio buildings. I think
      someone found them and a way to broadcast and make copies. It was interesting finding a cassette along my travels in the back of an old truck. Made me smile. Yeah, it's the end of the world, but music prevails!

      Mom. One of the Pure Alphas who I found half-grown in the research Bunkers, I named her PiG. In that tank, she looked like a large pig fetus, won't lie it was a bit creepy. But, you love who you love, and this one
      was special. untainted by Warlock, and free from the collective controls. I wanted to allow it to grow on its own terms and raise it as best I could. Perhaps one day she could be part of something bigger. She calls
      me Mom. So, I guess I am a Mom now.
    </p>
    <p>Life sure has been a wild trip. I hope you make the best of where your life is now. Make a difference. Use your common sense. Don't be an asshole.</p>
