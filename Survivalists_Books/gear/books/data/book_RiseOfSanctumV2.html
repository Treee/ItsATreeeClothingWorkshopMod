      After the five awoke from their experience in the tomb, they found themselves on a sandy beach nestled in the heart of the archipelago. Surrounding them were artefacts from their escapade: armour, paintings,
      banners, books, but they were acutely aware of how thirsty they were. Crawling to a small body of water, they lapped it up and wiped their mouths clean before recoiling in shock at the sight of their own
      appearance.

      Where an iris once lay, a pool of yellow and gold , identical to that of the figure depicted in the tomb. With minds o'fog, they collected as much as they could carry and set off on a trail towards one of the
      tribal villages hidden deep in the forest, where they received guidance back to their home. This adventure served as the spark which ignited a dormant flame within the five, one which had been drowned and quenched
      after their former way of life was obliterated, and so began the Sanctum.

      Putting their carpentry knowledge to use, they provided homes to individuals that they had heard whisper of being mistreated by the prominent factions at the time. Simultaneously, they were translating a hefty book
      that they had found within the tomb, written in Latin. It gave direction and guidance, with the author being Aurelian, an Emperor during the Crisis of the Third Century.

      In the far west they mustered a small force of folk and began teaching them how to navigate the redefined landscape of the isle, entering petty conflicts with the larger factions. One such conflict was with a group
      calling themselves "The Imperial Legion", who intruded into the Sanctum's territory and attempted to conduct robberies. Despite being outnumbered, the Sanctum won the conflict but at great cost: the life of a
      hastati *2 legionary, Yorak. The Imperial Legion explained that their presence in Sanctum territory was due to an ex-member of theirs fleeing, which deviated from their code.

      Sirius of Sanctum demanded the hand of the man who killed Yorak, which Imperial leadership agreed to. However, the man who killed him refused and unpinned a grenade, causing the Imperials to kill him too. The
      explosion gave way to a bounty of chaos as the ex-member who the Imperials were hunting revealed himself from a nearby base and began firing upon the Sanctum, the Imperials and the Riders of Portland who had came
      to assist the Sanctum. Tank of the Riders swiftly eliminated the threat, giving way to peace between the factions.

      Sanctum persisted in learning more about their newfound physiology and expanded upon their fascination for the Roman ways. They incorporated a leadership style similar to that of the Republic with modifying
      elements, with Sirius, Tyler and a veteran member known as Dale serving as the heads of the faction. The quest for knowledge brought them to the gates of Altar, an ESPEN-affiliated organisation that had access to a
      vault of information otherwise lost to mankind. A French-Canadian scholar calling himself 'Director Tremblay' taught the Sanctum the intricacies of the Roman Republic and later Empire, as well as assisting in
      translating the book they had found. With his help, it was discovered the book offering direction on how to lead was the journal of Lucius Domitius Aurelianus - known as Aurelian, or 'Restitutor Orbis', meaning
      'Restorer of the World'.

      Time flew by. Sanctum became increasingly involved in the island's activity and before long they were offering carpentry lessons to settlements around the isle who were intrigued by this new way of building. One
      such settlement was the people of Idlehollow that resided in a sandy expanse located south of Westbrook. Their ideals aligned with that of the Sanctum, and after extensive discussion between the council, they
      decided to make the exit from the west, their recluse, and officially rejoin the island once more.
