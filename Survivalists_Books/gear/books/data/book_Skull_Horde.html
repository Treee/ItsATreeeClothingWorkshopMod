		<title>The Horror of The Skull Horde</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<br/>
		<p>It wasn’t long after the outbreak until people started to turn on each other. As the islands became engulfed by panic; looting, robbing, and fighting began across all of Deer Isle. Behaviours which, unfortunately, show no signs of ending.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>As the months went on, fights turned into murders, robbing turned into raiding and things began to get extreme. It was at this point in time that stories of cannibalism started to spread. “I heard they wear the skulls of their victims as masks”... “I was told that they keep you alive as they cut off your flesh.”... “I saw them once, dragging people away as they kicked and screamed.” Stories like these spread like wildfire across the island and soon everyone had heard the name Skull Horde</p>
		<br/>
		<p>Not much was or is, known about the Skull Horde. Those that survived attacks from these savages were either knocking on death’s door by the time they were found or were driven mad from what they had seen. From what we have been able to gather the Skull Horde is a small group of individuals, most likely all-male, who have roamed across the island from the start of the outbreak and have been driven mad by the Kuru Virus. This Virus for those who are unaware, according to Dr. J. Revitt; “is a very rare disease that is caused by an infectious protein (prion) found in contaminated human brain tissue. The Kuru Virus causes brain and nervous system changes similar to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.” - Revitt, J (1994). A Study of Rare and Exotic Diseases</p>
		<br/>
		<p>With their brains slowly deteriorating and their hunger for human flesh growing ever stronger, the Skull Horde was known to prey on lone survivors wandering around the southern areas of Deer Isle. Their most notorious hunting ground around the town of Oceanville. This spot was frequently travelled through by survivors as they ventured towards Camp Bear, an abandoned military camp, in search of ammunitions and weaponry.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>Slowly people started setting up camps nearby this island, offering their protection to lonely survivors for a small fee of food and nails (The going currency on the island at this point in time). This, however, did not deter the Skull Horde. They seemed to be experts in stalking their prey, waiting until they are at their most vulnerable until they strike!</p>
		<br/>
		<p>Once again, fear and panic began to spread around the island. Not because of the infected that plagued the island, or the bandits that inhabited it. But because of the thought that a man was capable of committing such inhumane acts and that there was nothing left to stop them.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>This led to the creation of The Keepers. Their sole mission was to block the through route into Oceanville and create a checkpoint in which survivors would be stopped and search upon entry and exit of this small island. Which they did in relative success. The Skull Horde’s attacks around Oceanville had ceased…. But they still had not been stopped.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>The Skull Horde had been spotted moving further North. Stories of survivors who headed out to scavenge, but never returned, began to crop up once again. Whilst the Keepers had secured Oceanville, it was only a small victory in the grand scheme of things. Not only had they been spotted up North, but also to the West, within Westbrook, and also to the East, along the shores. Their numbers were growing.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>As mentioned previously, little is known about the Skull Horde. Survivors to this day are still unsure if the Skull Horde grew in size or, the more fearful thought, people began to idolize and imitate them. Regardless, cannibalism was becoming a more prevalent threat on Deer Isle and it did not show any signs of slowing down.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>Because of this, people began to take arms and unite. The larger groups on the island; The Keepers, The Outsiders, The Wardens and Blackstone decided to form a coalition (Not to be confused with ‘The Coalition’) with the goal of wiping out the Skull Horde once and for all. They started a war.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>The Skull Horde, as far as we could tell, lost this war. There were bodies of survivors scattered all around the town of Kushville. Some wore skull masks, some wore armbands of the united factions. And some, sadly, bore no armband or colours at all… They appeared as just innocent survivors, stuck in the crossfire. </p>
		<br/>
		<p>Unfortunately, the war amounted to nothing, nothing but the loss of more survivors lives. Stories of cannibalism continued to spread around the island and reports of missing scavengers and travellers still continued to come in. </p>
		<br/>
		<p>Yes, people stopped reporting sitings of cannibals and individuals wearing human skulls on their faces. But these can simply be taken off. Clothes are easy to change. These cannibals could still be at large, settling among us in our towns and societies. Unfortunately, there is no way to tell. Not until it is too late anyway.</p>
