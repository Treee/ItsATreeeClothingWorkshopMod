    <p>
      Canticles of Morale Improvement<br />

      Fellow scions of the Omnissiah, rejoice for that which we are given this day!<br />
      This blighted place is host to abominations of xenos flesh and heretical unsanctioned science, and it is the will of our God that we scour them from these halls.<br />
      Let bullet and beam give voice to your fury. Let boots and treads crush alien skulls. And should you fall in this holy effort give praise, for today is a most wondrous day to die!<br />
      -=Final transmission of Magos Dominus Menodon Kursk, during his descent onto the Genestealer corrupted world of Amaclad III⁑<br />

      Our collective suffering in bodies of flesh is not a punishment from the Machine God, but rather an intended source of motivation. In flesh we are ephemeral, our lives inherently limited. In confronting this, we
      are driven to extend our short existences, to leave lasting marks on the world, or to appreciate what time we have all the more intensely. Were we born in metal, what would drive us? What would drive us to achieve
      what we have without the urgency of a decaying form? The flesh is weak, but it is precisely this weakness that drives us to be strong.<br />
      The Machine God takes pride in the achievements of all of you, however small they seem. For every day, you carve an existence from this uncaring universe, and battle to keep your flesh functioning which can be a
      truly grueling task for many. Do not give in, no matter how hopeless the road ahead. Every second of your continued endurance is a victory for which you shall be lauded upon your natural passing, and I wish for
      your roll of honour to be long indeed.<br />
      Ave Omnissiah, ferrum sunt æterna.<br />

      Blind and deaf<br />

      Such torment is our holy weapon<br />

      Flesh is weak, Men are not<br />
      Skin withers, meat rots<br />
      Death is certain, but is not soon<br />
      Life in metal, the Omnissiah’s boon<br />

      Never again fear will you feel<br />
      Your purpose known, all things made right<br />
      Such is the blessing of Machine Might!<br />
      -=Canticle 0101: Invocation of Machine Might⁑<br />

      Immortal Omnissiah hear our prayers<br />
      We are your servants, the executors of your Grand Design<br />
      We march into the crucible of war, and we beseech you to walk by our side<br />
      Bestow upon us the blessings of your omniscient sight and direct us where you will<br />
      By our action may your Grand Design be wrought upon the stars Omnissiah bless us all, may we bring glory unto thee<br />

      Speaker 2 [exalt]:<br />
      -=Translation of binharic prayer spoken by Moderatus Prime Zerkei Metalis Gevren and Moderatus Secundus Haili<br />

      O Omnissiah, hear my prayer. As I prepare to enter the crucible of battle, I ask for your blessings and guidance. May my weapons be true and my aim steady, that I may strike down the enemies of the Imperium with
      righteous fury. May my armor be strong and my machine-spirit unwavering, that I may withstand the assaults of the enemy and emerge victorious.<br />
      Grant me the knowledge and understanding to make the most of my abilities, that I may serve the Emperor and the Imperium to the best of my ability. May my faith in you, the Machine God, be unshakable, that I may
      face all challenges with courage and resolve.<br />
      O Omnissiah, guide my footsteps and lead me to victory. May the enemies of the Imperium tremble at the sight of my holy armor and the roar of my blessed weapons. For the glory of the Emperor and the Omnissiah, I
      offer my service and devotion. Blessed be the Machine God.<br />
      -=Forge-Master Locke of the Dark Krakens†<br />

      The storms of our world harden us<br />
      The tools of the ancients protect us<br />
      The wisdom of the Magi guides us<br />
      For Machine God and Omnissiah yet to come, for knowledge and holy artifacts, for the red sands of Mars, none shall stay our march.<br />
      -=Unattributed⁑<br />

      Omnissiah hear our prayers,<br />
      You, whose power is everywhere.<br />
      Grant us iron in our bones, and metal beasts that whir and groan<br />
      Help us learn, help us rise,<br />
      May we see with shining eyes<br />
      How to build, how to make, how to teach and how to break. In your name.<br />
      Beneath your reign.<br />
      All that plagues us shall be slain!<br />

      -=Litany of Praise: translation of binharic static chorus<br />

      ● Rejoice. Give thanks. For we are but one step now from triumph.<br />
      -=Canticles of Mars, 79.12<br />

      ● We have seen nanomachines devour worlds. We have seen cities uprooted and marched into battle. We have seen fortresses fight like men, and men as unbreakable as adamantium. We have seen Warp fiends drive armies
      mad, and machines that demand the viscera of infants as fuel. This galaxy is hostile to us. It is our duty combined to ensure our future.<br />
      -=Binary Saints 0000 - 0111 Conglomerate (BS 0-3C), a sanctified union of the Machine Spirit of Ark Mechanicus “Progress to Infinity” and the cloned minds of the Council of Binary Saints. Expedition to Mars.
      M25⁑<br />

      ● Machine God be praised this relief. Though we are unfaltering in our service, he has blessed us with rest sorely needed. Soothe your flesh. Thank your iron. Focus your minds. Steel your souls. This war is not
      over.<br />
      -=Unattributed⁑<br />

      ● Strike down your foes without mercy. Trample their bodies under your iron boots. Cleanse them in totality, and let fear be a weakness known only to your foe.<br />
      -=Unattributed⁑<br />

      ● It is you that honour me, With your words, your thoughts and deeds. With every cog, servo and piston. With every beat of your indomitable hearts and every drop of precious blood.<br />
      -=Archmagos Explorator Omnid Torquora<br />

      ● I am one with the Motive Force. One with the Great Maker – He who crafts all true constructs in one of His many images. He who infuses, fills with His power, lends His strength.<br />
      -=Unattributed<br />

      ● It is my duty as Logi Prime of this facility to tell you the odds of our survival are slim. However it is my duty as a human to tell you that everything will be fine, and that I am doing everything in my power to
      ensure so, independent of those odds.<br />
      -=Attributed to 13.65-Æ Proximo, during the Fall of Tyran⁑<br />

      ● Nothing is ever lost, only changed, transmuted, recycled, as our lives continue on in the service of the Machine God’s Grand Design. From every failure can come future victory, from every obstacle an opportunity
      for greater prestige. Through me does the Omnissiah wish to assure you that your potential and your will is sufficient to achieve what you desire, so long as you continue to adjust, adapt, and endure to inevitably
      shifting circumstance.<br />
      -=Unattributed⁑<br />

      ● Purify it with flames, for this is the wish of the Omnissiah!<br />
      -=Aphorisms 43<br />

      ● Awaken, citizens of Mars, for the coming of the most holy day. Let the forges spit fire, let lightning crackle between our towers, for today we labor in gratitude most infinite. May your limbs never tire, may
      your songs echo into the void, and may the presence of the Machine God be undeniable in any construct of flesh or metal! Rejoice for the victories of the past, and give thanks for the opportunities of the future,
      for we are the Omnissiah’s most blessed scions and in our service we are rendered eternal!<br />
      -=Annual Declaration given by the Fabricator General on the 12th day of the Martian year, recorded as the date of Martian unity in ~445.M27⁑<br />

      ● Behold the light of the Machine God comrades. Let its holy radiation burn into flesh and metal. Lift up your souls in awe, that they might burn as candles beside a fragment of His own divinity, rendered in fire
      before us. Blessed is our world for this honor. All Praise to Lucius. All Praise to the Omnissiah. All Praise to the Machine God and his Wonders!!<br />
      -=Speech given by Archmagos Drakol Kirik, during the 337th War of Iron Puppets, Invasion of Lucius, Third Tyrannic War⁑<br />

      ● For all the great weapons I have made in my life, the great plasma cannons, ion beams, volkite annihilators, radiation wasters, and dimensional shifting lasers, none are so uniquely satisfying as a bullet. While
      I can kill a foe with the exotic wrath of mechanical god weapons, none carry the same human touch, the same weight of history. To kill the alien with our greatest wonders, is to proclaim ourselves akin to gods. To
      slay the alien with a gunshot is to demonstrate we do not need to be in order to triumph.<br />
      -=Unattributed⁑<br />

      ● Let our enemies come. Let their blood be the unguent that greases the wheels of our endless blessed artifice.<br />
      -=Vanguard Unit 09-Tyba, Radtainment Division<br />

      ● You are the Steel Bulwark. The Iron Shield. The implacable guards of the life of the Fabricator General. You are the Machine God’s protection manifested in soldiers of metal and only the most pious flesh. Against
      this onslaught of heresy most abominably biological, you of [Forge World]’s elite warriors shall do as we have done for millennia. With bullet and blare, radium and roar, flame and fanfare, you will scour our world
      clean once more. Omne Diabolus Vitae Exterminatus<br />
      -=Unattributed⁑<br />

      ● As the spirit of your rifle is to you, so are you a weapon in the hand of the Tech-Priests, through them the Omnissiah, and through him the Machine God. Wield this weapon as you would be wielded in turn.
      -=Unattributed⁑ ● Admission of insufficiency is itself a weakness, if a logical one. Consider failure to be an impossibility, and put forth your greatest effort, then you shall behold the wonders you can
      achieve.<br />
      -=Father of Iron Jorgirr Shidd⁑<br />

      ● Although flesh may blacken and fail, fear not, for this too can be replaced. You can be reincarnated - reborn in steel by the will of the Omnissiah.<br />
      -=Excerpt from The First Litany of the Doctrina Augmentata<br />

      ● The Omnissiah directs our footsteps along the path of knowledge.<br />
      -=Soylens Viridians for the Machine-Spirit<br />

      ● Disable all safeguards. Open all shields. Vent all weapons. Let the heretics witness the horror of a Martian rad storm marching to war beside us.<br />
      -=Vanguard Alpha Primodius Zhar<br />

      ● There's no turning back... Triumph or oblivion!<br />
      -=The spirit of Ramus Macabee speaking to Ervin Hekate<br />

      ● As we purify the ground beneath their feet, they shall find no shelter!<br />
      -=Macharian Commentaries Chapter 71<br />

      ● Let the foe blunt their blades against our resolve. They will be ash and memories soon enough.<br />

      Hark ye servants of the Emperor and the Omnissiah, for this corrupted ground shall be host to a miracle most profound. Upon this day we shall invoke the spirit of our very God to fight with us in glorious battle.
      But be wary, guardsmen, for this is no easy matter, even for one of my skill, you must be the wall that shields our spirits afore the miracle can be made. Your resolve must be as iron, so you may honor the steel of
      the God-Engine’s blessed form. As the pikes are set, subtle prayers are made to gird the souls, and the aegis of your armor is tightened, we stand ready to begin the ritual. Commence! The Omnissiah looked upon ye
      with adoration in ages past, through lust and rust and war.<br />
      He sent his blessed rays down upon your steel form, the rippling reflections shimmering as holy fire.<br />
      And from those fleeting liminal waves, shone interstellar fury from long forgotten days of yore.<br />
      As from you… You divine creature, flares the Machine God’s holy pyre.<br />
      Though you carried the torch high and proud, dark eyes saw the light,<br />
      Dreadful minds put wicked schemes into play.<br />
      They defiled you with the rotten fruits of their labor, cruelly taking away your might. But their plans will not come into fruition, much to their dismay!<br />
      You failed in the eyes of the Deus Mechanicus…<br />
      But failure can be an opportunity for growth, Broken limbs may mend with steel, fractured minds may be offered solace.<br />
      Your flaring ember of life still carries strength enough for strength enough for us both.<br />
      So we entreat upon thee, heed our prayers!<br />
      You can cast off the shame of yesterday, and look forward to tomorrow!<br />
      That which was sundered may be made whole, as we peel back unnecessary layers.<br />
      Through our power and Omnissiah’s grace, we shall free thee from your sorrow!<br />
      The soul of the Machine God surrounds thee.<br />

      than those we have destroyed in the Machine-God’s name. Temples warped of purpose. Flesh from which proceeds an iron unholy and untrue. Weapons without spirit. An affliction from which we shall release them,

      harnessed the hidden fire, and used it for our own purposes. Then we saw the fire could burn within living things, unnoticed until it destroyed them. And we were afraid. We built great tombs to hold the fire for
      one hundred thousand years, after which it would no longer kill. If this place is opened, the fire will not be isolated from the world, and we will have failed to protect you. Leave this place and never come

      Hear the word of the Omnissiah,<br />
      For they are the god of machines,<br />
      We are the servants of the machine god,<br />
      We are the Adeptus Mechanicus.<br />
      Our vigilance persists and our bodies strong,<br />
      We are the masters of the forge and the forge world,<br />
      We seek the secrets of the past,<br />
      We seek the power of the future.<br />
      In the name of the Omnissiah,<br />
      We offer up our bodies and minds,<br />
      For the pursuit of knowledge and power,<br />
      In service to the machine god.<br />
      -=An Unknown Magos†<br />

      From the Machine God, comes the Motive Force<br />
      From the Motive Force comes life<br />
      In life I pursue knowledge<br />
      To do so is an act of faith<br />
      From faith I draw strength<br />
      With strength my will is done<br />
      By my will is my mind ordered<br />
      In order is peace found<br />
      In peace is my purpose known<br />
      My purpose is to serve the Machine God<br />
      May He bless my mind with calm<br />
      -=Unattributed⁑<br />

      Without the Machine God, we are nothing.<br />
      His light shines through the shattered remains of the Omnissiah, without whom we could not travel the stars.<br />
      Without the Machine God and his Spirit children, stagnation would consume us, and our technology would fail.<br />
      Blind, and defenseless, the might of humanity would crumble and wither.<br />
      Give thanks to the Machine God! Give thanks to the Omnissiah! For they protect us eternally, against the horrors that thirst for our blood and souls!<br />

      With learning I cleanse my flesh of ignorance.<br />

      -=First Prayer of the Omnissiah<br />

      ● Against the deepest of ignorance and most vehement frustration, the Machine God’s desire to see us learn and understand the world around us shall always triumph. His greatest gift to us is the blessing of
      sapience, the divine spark that allows us to pursue the enlightened state of true comprehension. Its attainment is a challenge of literally inhuman magnitude, but that does not diminish the significance of an
      individual’s own steps along the path towards it. May you be blessed this day. May that which blights your mind be made clear to you. May that which frustrates you be stricken from your path. May your eyes see with
      clarity and your limbs execute your understanding with righteous and justified certainty. Praise the Machine God, for the joy of learning and the wonders it grants us.<br />
      -=Unattributed⁑<br />

      ● A short life of learning is worth more than entire centuries of ignorance.<br />
      -=Unattributed⁑<br />

      ● Praise the Machine-God for the artifices that deliver us from death.<br />
      -=Ghelsa vin Jaint, while being protected from a phosphex warhead bombardment by an imperator titan’s void shields.<br />

      ● Carry your knowledge like a shining lantern, and cast back the crawling shadows of ignorance.<br />
      -=Unattributed⁑<br />

      ● No man is inherently more blessed than another in the light of the Machine God. We are all born with the spark of the Motive Force running through us, and any deformation of body or mind does not change that.
      Where we gain or lose the Machine God’s favor is in the choices we make, and whether they serve to expand mankind’s knowledge, or progress our own selfish interests.<br />
      -=Unattributed⁑<br />

      ● Praise the Omnissiah for the gift of His artifice, in His eternal knowledge are we shrouded from harm.<br />
      -=Ghelsa vin Jaint, after seeing synskin armor protect an ally from multiple bolt rounds.<br />

      ● It is not our enhancements or our upgrades that the Machine God loves us for, but the faithful servant and learning being within. Any man with enough coin may wield a body of steel, but only the Machine God can
      grant the hunger for knowledge that pervades His champions.<br />
      -=Unattributed⁑<br />

      ● Hold no hate for those ignorant of the Omnissiah, for to do so would be no different than to judge a man as blind for having never been shown the sun.<br />
      -=Unattributed⁑<br />

      ● It is not by the Machine God’s will that events occur, for that implies He resists and influences a greater mechanism. The Machine God is the foundation of the universe, and it’s occurrences are not by his will,
      but by his design.<br />
      -=Unattributed<br />

      ● By the grace of the Omnissiah, may I overcome all challenges placed before me. May I be sound of mind, strong of body, and clear of purpose in his service. Through my labors, may I be elevated in His eyes, and
      bring honor to my world. May my forge and magos be blessed for their care of me, and may I serve them with distinction on this day.<br />

      -=Excerpt: Collected Prayers of the Tharsus Campaigns, M26⁑<br />

      ● Those who don the blinkers of wilful ignorance may no longer bear witness to the true illumination of the Omnissiah. Even amidst the deepest shadows, we bathe in that holy light.<br />
      -=Dak-XXVII, Culax Black Guard<br />

      ● Holy Omnissiah, whose mind knows all and gaze sees all things. Whose Designs encompass all that is and ever shall be. Visit upon us knowledge of that which is to come. Guide our minds along the vast calculations
      of that which is to come. Machine God show us the way through the darkness of confusion. Illuminate us by the Motive Force that pulses within all your blessed constructs. May nothing escape our sight!<br />
      -=Benediction of Omniscience⁑<br />

      ● When one aligns with the circuits of the Machine God, perfidious humor and fleshly sarcasm will break against your mental fortitude.<br />
      -=Fabricator General Hades Kelbor#12-2502 of Obseq-Asper†<br />

      ● A man may die yet still endure if his work enters the greater work. Time is carried upon a current incepted by forgotten deeds. Events of great moment are but the culmination of a single carefully placed thought.
      As all men must thank progenitors obscured by the past so we must endure the present that those who come after may continue the greater work.<br />
      -=Garba Mojaro, The Chime of Eons<br />

      ● When Deimos and Phobos are at apogee and perigee, there thou shalt see the face of the Omnissiah. Clad in a body of gold, and wreathed in the firmament of the storm, the Lord of all Machines will stand in the
      midst of his people, and shall reign over all the dominion of Man. Great shall be the glory of his presence, that the sun shall hide his face in shame. For verily I say unto you that he shall be the Alpha and the
      Omega, the beginning and the end, the master of flesh and the forger of metal. He shall be a light that shineth in darkness and a banisher of ignorance.<br />
      -=The Coming of the Omnissiah, exloaded by Pico della Moravec, Primus of the Brotherhood of Singularitarianism<br />

      ● I was broken when they found me. My body burned, my soul shriveled, only my mind still stood firm. The Adepts of Mars took me in, and introduced me to the glory of the machine. Where muscles seized, pistons did
      not. Where eyes failed to focus, cameras did not. Where my voice was cracked and afraid, now all who hear me tremble. I was born into this world weak, entombed in flesh. The servants of the Omnissiah set me free,
      and the Machine God made me strong.<br />
      -=Unattributed⁑<br />

      ● Do not ask the Omnissiah for a pleasant existence, ask Him for the strength to overcome our tribulations.<br />
      -=Aphorisms 62<br />

      ● Venerate the machines under your care, for they will endure far beyond the limits of your flesh. Your flesh will rot, their steel will endure, your life will end, and they will carry your memory ever onwards.<br />
      -=Unattributed⁑<br />

      ● Pain is a deception, a lie. Some among the Biologis protest that it is a natural warning of injury, but this is a falsehood. Biological matter is in a perpetual state of inevitable decay, wounds only speed up the
      process. Pain suggests that in its absence all is well, and this cannot be countenanced for it is demonstrably incorrect. Pain is to be disregarded, and ignored, for all it tells you is what you already know. The
      flesh is weak, and we must escape it.<br />

      On the Pursuit of Knowledge<br />

      The Quest for Knowledge is our sacred task.<br />
      Ours is not to understand or question,<br />
      Ours is to possess, to reclaim, to seize.<br />
      Ours is the logic and the power.<br />
      That which is not in the hands of the Omnissiah’s faithful is in the hands of the heretics.<br />
      Ours is not to understand or question.<br />
      -=Vows Acquitorius, Verse One<br />

      The pursuit of knowledge is absolution.<br />
      The conceit of absolute knowledge is merely hubris.<br />

      -=Unattributed⁑<br />

      ● Protect, archive, copy, record. So many terms intended for a singular purpose, that which defines our order. Remembrance. The relentless preservation of all we have and all we seek, that it might never again be
      lost. Every written word, every typed numeral, every sheaf of molding parchment, is an act of faith for the Cult Mechanicus. Blessed are we for this task.<br />
      -=Martian Piety, Prime Hermeticon Octoberon Nûr (trans. High Ranking Preserver, Distributor, and Gatherer of Knowledge)⁑<br />

      ● Universal logic dictates that all fleshly and intellectual pursuits are objectively of lesser validity and importance to the Opus Magnum of archeotech. Those who do not seek such things, should be treated as the
      unnecessary components they pursue; and be promptly discarded to the fires of the Forges of Mars as all extraneous items are.<br />

      ● No machine is arbitrary, for in its workings is found the faultless logic of the Omnissiah.<br />
      -=Teachings of the Cult Metalica<br />

      ● The Omnissiah filled the galaxy with mysteries so that we might learn from them, coming step by step closer to his perfect being. To ignore them, even in the face of war, is heresy!<br />
      -=Belisarius Cawl<br />

      ● My god is the incarnation of knowledge itself, and learning is the highest form of worship. Drive your mind like a spear into the subject you seek to learn, and saturate it with the discoveries within.<br />
      -=Unattributed⁑<br />

      ● Let nothing dissuade your quest for knowledge. Let none slow your pursuit and acquisition of holy technology. Let no one stand between you and the procurement of that which is rightfully the Machine God's due.<br />
      —Thusdorius Knoch, Invictus Acquisitor<br />

      Principles of Design<br />
      Beauty provokes envy.<br />
      Envy is of the flesh.<br />
      The flesh is weak.<br />

      Our defining tenant in our modifications should be function over form, effectiveness over aesthetic. To do otherwise is to indulge your flesh and admit your sinful attachment to it. Murdered 66 days later in a
      manner consistent with a short lived Slaaneshi daemon incursion. The cause was never identified.⁑<br />

      ● No secrets. No lies. Only truth. The Machine God demands truth. Personal gain is no excuse for preventing the dissemination of holy knowledge. It is intended for all mankind to use and access equally. To prevent
      this is heresy.<br />
      -=Datasymbiote Phaedro Torr, “Font of Secrets”, Mechanicum founding member, M25⁑<br />

      ● The beast of metal endures longer than the flesh of men. Those that tend the beasts of metal must labour long to learn its ways, for a single beast must suffer the mastership of many men until ready to shed its
      vorpal coils. Those that seek apprenticeship must attended closely to the runes of mobilisation, the rites of maintenance, and the words-of-power that describe the parts of a beast. Nor must they neglect the
      tutelage of the Adeptus Prefects, nor the casting of the proper roboscopes.<br />

      ● Bio-chauvinism, and on such a small scale, when it comes to the processing of knowledge, is laughable. Give me any savant you care, and I shall match his worth tenfold with even the most basic of Machine

      -=Linguis Fulminatus, Chapter 7<br />

      Other Postulations<br />

      Learning is, in and of itself, worship of the Machine God. To understand and to comprehend knowledge is a blessing, and a duty done in reverent service to His will.<br />
      The Omnissiah knows all, comprehends all, and mortal though we are, it is a mark of distinction for one to give their utmost towards doing the same. A futile task though it is, the value of the journey is not
      diminished by this in any regard.<br />
      -=Unattributed⁑<br />

      ● When uttering the incantation, mark well that the rod is upon and not within the intake. The second incantation should not be uttered until all the fumes have come forth, then the way shall be clear for the

      -=The Book of Five Runes<br />

      ● Traitors come to claim our iron. The iron that flows red through our veins. That lends our limbs and weapons strength. That forms the plate that protects us from bolt, beam and the hostile void. Blessed iron that
      sits pure in the rock and dirt of forge worlds we call our own. They call themselves the Warriors of Iron but they know nothing of its true value. We celebrate iron as a medium through which man and god might
      become one. It is holy. It is the Omnissiah’s strength, taken into our bodies. Where we break, iron makes us whole. Iron makes us more. We fuse iron to our flesh in the sacred act of interface, so that we might
      someday transcend the frailties of mortality and serve the Machine-God beyond our years. Through iron we become part of forever.<br />
      -=Archmagos Explorator Omnid Torquora<br />

      ● Strike the first rune upon the engine's casing employing the chosen wrench. Its tip should be anointed with the oil of engineering using the proper incantation when the auspices are correct. Strike the second
      rune upon the engine's casing employing the arc-tip of the power-driver. If the second rune is not good, a third rune may be struck in like manner to the first. This is done according to the true ritual laid down
      by Scotti the Enginseer. A libation should be offered. If this sequence is properly observed the engines may be brought to full activation by depressing the large panel marked "ON".<br />

      -=Adept’s Prayer (Given prior to one of the many exams an aspiring adept must complete to ascend within the ranks of the Cult Mechanicus)⁑<br />

      Take in that which is corrupted, that which is negative.<br />
      Purify it within the glory of your form.<br />
      Radiate that which is positive and life giving.<br />
      The Motive Force flows within us all, and it is our duty to ensure this is not forgotten.<br />
      That is what it means to be an Electro Priest. We are placed to tend to the circuit that connects all constructs, and we shall shine so brightly it outstrips the stars.<br />
      -=Electromancer Ohmni Radeon-Phi, “Transformer Primus”, M25⁑ Machine God invest us<br />

      May our bodies be burned and purged of sickness and plague<br />
      May our minds be exorcised of forgetfulness and confusion<br />
      May our hearts be guarded against despair and hopelessness<br />
      May our souls be sanctified and blessed against apostasy and corruption<br />
      By fire, lightning, and holy radiation may we bring annihilation to this weakness of flesh made manifest before us!<br />
      -=Canticle Metalica (Broadcasted during the Death Guard invasion of the Forge World Metallica, and subsequent cleansing actions)⁑<br />

      O eternal Emperor, who alone watches us,<br />
      and rules the tides and storms,<br />
      be compassionate to your servants,<br />
      preserve us from the perils of the warp,<br />
      that we may be a safeguard to the domain of men.<br />
      -=Prayer of Safe Return (to be used before entering the warp)<br />

      Apologies, mighty Casus Belli,<br />
      In error I have sought by force that which I should have asked permission to do.<br />

      The tide of knowledge flows thick with lies.<br />
      One who listens may find a truth in sight,<br />
      Built upon the shoulders of slumbering giants they rise.<br />
      A small mote in an ocean of darkened dull light sighs,<br />
      Content with a feeble existence of flesh and life and blight,<br />
      The tide of knowledge flows thick with lies.<br />
      The fools dwell within their cantilevered tower of lies,<br />
      Data-stacking, ever climbing, limbs clacking, isolating from the light,<br />
      Built upon the shoulders of slumbering giants they rise.<br />
      The four gods in true heaven watch reverently in their gentle guise,<br />
      The mind of ten thousand true souls reverberate with might,<br />
      The tide of knowledge flows thick with lies.<br />
      Twenty thousand years of flies, of fleeting, feeding flies,<br />
      Protecting, pouncing, petty, consumed by religious fright,<br />

      No longer shackled in our ecclesiarchical ties,<br />

      ||Scrapcode Infestation Purged|| - Ave Omnissiah!<br />

      All powerful Machine God, I come before you broken.<br />
      My capacitors are drained, my will is spent, my spirit eroded by trial and conflict. Few other times has my being been reduced to such a state in your eyes. I have failed in my duties, and find myself adrift in my
      assignments, merely completing tasks without the comprehension of knowledge. Machine God, Iron Lord of Mars, I request aid if you have it. May the Motive Force invest me. May your power surround me. May your will
      drive my spirit and my actions once more. May I be unshackled from the constraints of my blighted mind, that I might better execute your will. May I be granted solace and sanctuary from the galaxy’s horrors, if
      only for a moment, that I might emerge from your protection all the stronger.<br />
      Ave Deus Mechanicus<br />
      -=Unattributed⁑<br />

      Most powerful and glorious Emperor,<br />
      who commands the winds and eddies of the galaxy,<br />
      we miserable men are adrift in peril,<br />
      we cry unto thee for help, save us, or we will perish.<br />
      We see how great and terrible thou art,<br />
      we fear you and offer our awe,<br />
      we fear naught but your wrath,<br />
      and beg a chance to prove ourselves,<br />
      so let us not die in the tumultuous of the warp.<br />
      -=Prayer for the Lost and Endangered (to be used in times of emergency when traveling the Warp)<br />

      This machine is discharged into your care.<br />

      Serve this machine, as you would have fight it for you. (response) - I shall.<br />

      -=Excerpt from the Ceremony of Commission<br />

      ● Fear the iron fist, for its grip is death.<br />
      -=Ferromort<br />

      ● Falter not under the burden of failure, the Machine God does not judge you by your mistakes, but by your efforts to correct them and improve yourself.<br />
      -=Unattributed⁑<br />

      ● Anarchy’s End has existed for far longer than either of us, loader, no matter what atrocities you may witness, believe that the machine-spirit has seen worse.<br />
      -=Enginseer Verman, discussing the history of the Baneblade “Anarchy’s End”.<br />

      ● You are to be commended for your contempt for flesh, but disciplined in equal measure for damaging it so callously. The glory of metal is an unfortunately rare blessing in this age, so for the time being, your
      flesh is all you have. Care for it. Protect it from harm and decay. It is the Machine God’s gift to you, for all its faults, in the hope that you would make best use of it out of any spirit under His care.<br />
      -=Theolurgic Ganymede Vetralio⁑<br />

      ● All praise to the machine-spirit, its vigil unwavering and its wrath unfailing. A name is more than just words, loader. It is purpose and conviction. Anarchy’s End will suffer no mutiny within its sacred decks.
      And neither should we. Keep your wits about you, there may be another traitorous soul waiting to reveal themselves for judgement.<br />
      -=Enginseer Verman of the Baneblade “Anarchy’s End”, regarding the sudden death of a traitor by unexplainable means.<br />

      ● I grow weary of this flesh I was born into, strangely disgusted by its nature. I crave only the cold, clean certainty of steel and silicon, that I might become one with the Blessed Machine. I do not expect you to
      understand, you who cling to your flesh as if it were immortal, seeking only to preserve it, to protect it. One day, you will see the folly of your ways, and then no doubt you will come begging to my order to
      preserve you...<br />
      -=Magos Deruss, making polite conversation with a minor scion of the House of Persis<br />

      ● Never trust. Never feel. Never act contrary to the Absolute Logic. You alone are strong. By your will and by your iron. In the end you will be left with nothing else.<br />
      -=Ordon Khul, “Ironclad”, Mechanicum founder, Cult of Metal Soul, M25. Expedition leader to Medusa, M26⁑<br />

      ● This is the cycle that marks your transition to the Serberys Corps. Your efficacy has been noted, your performance falling within holy tolerances of judication and your signifiers selected by none other than
      Magos-Haptic Pol Yogethen. Your bonding to a cybercanid is a gift from the Omnissiah. Waste it and face deletion. Employ your existence to the glory of the Machine God and in praise of the holy works of His
      priesthood – it is the only logical course of action for Mankind.<br />
      -=Marshal of the Iron Cohort, Solun-23y<br />

      ● Chance is just an imprecise understanding of probability. You, or someone like you, would come eventually. And you did. In time, the improbable becomes... inevitable.<br />
      -=Magos Dominus Castia-Theta-9, addressing Captain Orpheus of the Blood Angels<br />

      ● The administration of the Motive Force as corrective behavior is as much a lesson from the Machine God himself as from me or my superiors. When you’ve regained vocal control, please let me know what wisdom He saw
      fit to share with you.<br />
      -=Protector Oum 8-Chakai⁑<br />

      ● The delicacy of the Machine God’s Grand Design is no more clearly manifest than in the consequences of a misplaced 1 or 0.<br />
      -=Cognitor Khel Prhaddim, regarding the clerical error by the Administratum that resulted in the Exterminatus of his home forge world of Cherribrax⁑<br />

      ● Coordination of labour comes prior to division.<br />
      -=Haxaffa’s First Principle. An advisement to manufactorum workers based upon the posit that overseers risk inefficiencies by placing their requirements above those of the process they must guide.<br />

      ● Thresholds are the quintessential cog in the Machine God’s Great Work, they mark apotheosis and exile, advancement and disgrace. The crossing of an entryway may be an ingress to reformation, so watch your
      motions, note your aphelions, and chart your course accordingly.<br />
      -=Autosavant Chem-109 Enron†<br />

      ● Well corrupt my hard drive and call me Grandmaster Flashdrive and the Furious Five Knuckle Shufflers: the lubricant is flowing and I’m about to void the warranty on SOMETHING.<br />
      -=Logic-Warden RU-BN Tugmestres†<br />

      ● Henceforth no man shall set foot upon the world, and all around shall be set sentinels to ward away unwary spacecraft. We must accept that this place is lost to us forever, and is now the eternal habitation of
      abomination.<br />
      -=Excerpt from The Contagion of Ganymede⁑<br />

      ● You may say, it is impossible for a man to become like the Machine. And I would reply, that only the smallest mind strives to comprehend its limits.<br />
      -=Fabricator General Kane<br />

      ● The universe is not like a puzzle-box that you can take apart and put back together again and so solve its secrets. It is a shifting uncertain thing which changes as you consider it, which is changed by the very
      act of observation. A powerful man is not a man who dissects the universe like a puzzle-box, examining it piece by piece and measuring each piece with scientific precision. A powerful man has only to look upon the
      universe to change it.<br />
      -=Technomagos Gaelos<br />

      ● Your attempts at negotiation are futile. This world’s annexation is final. Do not contemplate resistance. Do not think. We will be doing that for you from now on.<br />
      -=Unattributed<br />

      ● Steel of Body, Steel of Mind.<br />

      ● In ancient times, men built wonders, laid claim to the stars and sought to better themselves for the good of all. But we are much wiser now.<br />

      ● Prayer has power, but I cannot deny fire does, too.<br />
      -=Archmagos Cortiko, Verse 58<br />

      ● When thou desires to discourse purely, use binary. -=Sayings of the Princeps 65.4 ● Such sweet music is the chatter of binary, that has no tongue to lie.<br />
      -=Sayings of the Archmagi, Appendix 4<br />

      ● My emotional cores return dismay and anger whenever a skitarius is described as disposable. No-one is disposable so long as they do the Omnissiah’s work. Thus it is written.<br />
      -=Magos Dominus Faustinius<br />

      ● Enough fire in the right place can solve any problem.<br />
      -=Colloquialisms of Metalica, Chapter 52<br />

      ● Inefficiency is a slope whereupon one slides ever downwards, by degrees, until one reaches the nadir of unknowing.<br />
      -=Canticles Borealis, 6.15<br />

      ● Men are weak. Their bodies will fail and crumble to dust. Only the Machine endures.<br />
      -=Magos Axos Zarin, 948.M41<br />

      ● If His Will be done, let it be done quickly.<br />

      -=Aphorisms 97<br />

      -=Colloquialisms Minor, Chapter 51<br />

      ● High risk, high reward.<br />
      -=Magi Pecuniam<br />

      ● No task that is easy is ever worthwhile.<br />
      -=Amaranthine Verses 78.12<br />

      ● The circuits are complete. The engine of fate is primed. One turn of the cog remains, and the grand machine shall fulfill its purpose.<br />
      -=Logistae Septimus, 21.4<br />

      ● The broken in body can blame the bullet or the sword, but the broken in mind have all of creation to curse.<br />
      -=Verses Fulminatus, 59.31<br />

      On the Xenos<br />

      All knowledge in the galaxy lies waiting for us to find it. I refuse to stay my hand and reject the knowledge found in the claws of the alien.<br />
      There is no clearer gift from the Omnissiah than the technology wrested from xenos dead, for though their technology may be superior, it is to us that the Machine God grants victory, that we might sanctify the
      spoils of war in his name. With every alien technology we return to the Machine God’s embrace, we grow closer to him. None will stay our march.<br />
      -=Tech-Priest Timerius Quord (Planet of Origin: Stygies VIII) (Deployment: Damocles Gulf Crusade)⁑<br />

      ● The weak in mind will seek to understand the xenos. The strong in mind will destroy them, and bless their ignorance.<br />
      -=Binary Hierarch Gethsemorr<br />

      ● Tau weaponry. Aeldari psi-magic. Tyranid and Drukhari fleshcraft. Necron materiel and atom sorcery. All have something to teach us, and I will give every human life under my command in service to learning their
      workings for the Machine God. Proceed with the experiment. Remember nothing. Leave the recording to me.<br />
      -=Xenoscryer Secreta Dane, Heretek Xenus of Stygies VIII, abducted by Deathwatch Astartes, status unknown⁑<br />

      ● There is no more cursed place than the domains of alien gods, and no greater satisfaction than their destruction at the hands of our own.<br />
      -=Unattributed⁑<br />

      ● For the alien, nothing.<br />
      -=Legio Victorum Motto<br />

      ● Be thou wary of the works of the alien, for their presence is poison and their every word deceit.<br />
      -=Gathalamoreans, 94.3<br />

      ● Hark not the alien’s words, lest ye unknowingly repeat them.<br />
      -=Archmagos Veneratus Haelon<br />

      ● He who prosecutes the alien with zeal, is the ally of Mankind.<br />
      -=Gathalamorians 60.41<br />

      ● Of all creations most foul I beheld the Lord of All and knew that I was dead.<br />
      -=Recollections of Inquisitor Brand, Chapter 87<br />

      ● In each society there is a classification that is mirrored in another society.<br />
      -=Scripture-Brother Magos Tech-Auxilium Prime, Know Thy Enemy, to Know Thyself<br />

      ● The only logical response to the presence of the xenos, is hatred.<br />
      -=Verses Macrologica 17.4<br />

      ● To take what was once arming the Xenos, only to analyze, learn and improve it under the service of the Machine God is only heresy to those lacking both faith, and wisdom. For remaining ignorant of what clearly
      exists before your eyes is the greatest sin of all.<br />
      -=Unattributed†<br />

      ● The xenos must be purged, for the stars are humanity’s birthright.<br />
      -=Psalms Hermeticus 46<br />

      ● Seek not the words of the xenos, lest they infect us with blasphemy.<br />
      -=Admonitions Mechanae 3:16<br />

      ● We have determined with 27.439% accuracy that the xenos dwellings are built atop a human city, pre-dating the Age of Strife. The virus bombs are being consecrated as we speak. Cleansing can begin upon your
      order.<br />
      -=Technomancer-at-Arms Gryfe to Magos-Commodore Gnothis Trannarch, translated from binaric cant.<br />

      ● Take no shame in exulting at the destruction of the xenos. Though killing the alien is our solemn duty, that does not mean we cannot let it buoy up our spirits when it is accomplished.<br />
      -=Colloquialisms Minor, Chapter 51<br />
      <br />
      ● In the presence of the xenos lies the invisible miasma of corruption<br />
      -=Aphorisms of the Logic-Saints 7.91<br />

      ● Your petty claims of primacy disgust me xenos. This world bears the mark of the almighty Machine God. it is there in the fascism deposits left for us to extract. It is evident in the wells of trans-sulphur, in
      the liquid diamonite that rains from the sky and the seams of transuranium. This world belongs to mankind.<br />
      ● There are horrors in this galaxy that only faith and steel can overcome, and that we should be grateful we shall never fully understand.<br />
      -=Aphorisms 7.1<br />

      ● The only will of the Machine Spirit is that of the Omnissian technologies, for the xenos will deceive you and tempt you, but you will not falter, for you are a priest.<br />
      -=Cannot unless you Canticle, v.34<br />

      ● Our only objective should be death to the alien and all his works. All else is deviance from the Omnissiah Creed.<br />
      -=Life of Archmagos Borasis, Appendix 9<br />

      ● Look not upon the alien, for the alien looks back.<br />
