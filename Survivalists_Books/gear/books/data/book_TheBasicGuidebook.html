    <title>The Basic Guidebook</title>

    <p>This book serves as a general information text. In it are some basic to advanced recipes, as well as useful information for people to know.</p>

      One of the more commonly asked questions is where building-grade stone can be found on the isle. Whilst it is possible to mine stone from most rocks, it may not be suitable for construction of necessary
      fortifications, like flag poles. <br />
      A good place to find building-grade stone in the south is the Crotch Island quarry. Relatively central in the isle, there is a cluster of rocks at coordinates X4630, Y5570 that yields similar quality stone. If you
      are further north, there is several locations within the swamp. I know for certain that you can mine good stone from behind the big white building in RCFI. Keep in mind that there are many more locations around the
      isle and these are just the ones I know of – most maps have been marked with some tips on known locations.

      On the vein of construction, you will need planks. The most efficient way to gather a large amount of planks is finding a pile around the island and prying them apart with a crowbar or saw. I have managed to find
      several piles at the woodworking industrial in the northern region of the isle; I’ve also found some in Stonington industrial, Scouts Camp to the south, Fishers Camp to the south-east and Sunset Cross in the
      central regions. <br />
      If you only require a small amount of planks, you might be better served crafting a hand plane. If you are desperate, a bit of stone and firewood will be suitable to cut logs into planks but will break apart fairly
      easily. Replace stone with iron bars and you can craft a more durable, effective tool. <br />
      The basic tools you will need to fortify a small structure with a flag pole included is: a pickaxe, hatchet (or any axe), hammer (unless you have a hatchet) and pliers. <br />
      You will need short sticks and rope to construct a functioning schematic for a door. You will then need to cut some trees down to get logs and lay them down within the border of your schematic. Use your pickaxe or
      shovel to dig space into the ground so that they are sturdy. Place your planks and nails into the schematic borders and hammer them in. You will be locked in unless you have pliers and metal wire to twist hinges
      around to create a functioning door. Finally, you should attach a lock to the door. Do not forget to write down your code in case you need to change or remove it.

      The isle is home to various fishing hotspots. It seems these locations are host to more than just fish, as people have reported hooking tents, chests and even car parts, like doors and wheels. One obvious location
      is Fisher’s Camp. Less obvious locations is the boathouse west of Georgestown, which seems to be a popular place to find tents. Even more obscure locations are the oil rigs where people have caught large sharks and
      mutated fish. Perhaps the most uncanny spot is Barringer Crater – large tents, mutated fish and more has been discarded in the pool of water within.

      Whilst out on your adventures, be wary that you might encounter cybernetic or mutated animals. These are often stronger than their normal counterparts but are generally louder, allowing you to detect them from a
      further radius. The cyber bear is heavily armoured, meaning you should aim for exposed fur, whilst mutated wolves are simply more durable.

      You might happen upon a wrapped present from time to time. Inside, it seems survivors have left a note of their buried goods with coordinates, almost always forming a triangle. It is usually worth trying to find
      these, as you can find ammunition, artefacts (like replicas of Thor’s Hammer… which is VERY valuable to the right person), useful ore and company stim-packs. If you cannot read coordinates by now, that is your
      fault.

      Most people keep their known recipes private because it allows them to profit off of it. Some have invested hundreds of hours into perfecting specific recipes. In consideration of this, I shall share only the base
      ingredients of the recipes in most instances and allow you to experiment for yourself:
    </p>
    <p>
      Makeshift suppressor: plastic bottle + duct tape <br />
      Makeshift scope: can + wire
    </p>
    <p>
      Weapon sling: metal wire + civilian belt <br />
      Flag frame: flag + plank<br />
      Gun frame: sling + plank<br />
      Melee frame: sling + plank<br />
      Envelope: paper + paper<br />
      Tallow: 2 x warm chunks of fat mixed together<br />
      Stew: meat or vegetables mixed together<br />
      Canned food: meat or vegetables mixed together. Pour 4 cans contents into one. Bake. Seal with pliers.<br />
      Bread: flour + yeast<br />
      Makeshift NBC suit: 2 x rolls of duct tape wrapped together<br />
      Makeshift NBC filter: dust mask + plastic bottle, fill with charcoal tablets<br />
    </p>
    <p>These are only a few recipes in a vast sea of possibilities. The best way to learn more is speak with people and try out things for yourself. Many recipes require proper tools and workbenches to complete.</p>
