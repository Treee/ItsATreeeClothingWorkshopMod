		<p>At some point</p>
		<p>You care far too much</p>
		<p>About not caring that</p>
		<p>You spend all your time</p>
		<p>Not caring about caring</p>
		<p>Until you finall care</p>
		<p>But you care so much about not caring</p>
		<p>You care enough to not admit</p>
		<p>That you care since you care so much</p>
		<p>About not caring that you don't care about</p>
		<p>Not caring that you care</p>
		<br/>
		<p>All that is true for me.</p>
		<p>After hearing the echoing of that same word, does the word care now confuse your mind?</p>
		<br/>
		<p>That's how I feel about your name now.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>I've heard it echo in my thoughts too many times</p>
		<p>And the meaning has now detached itself</p>
		<p>From the sound</p>
		<br/>
		<p>Because every time I don't care that I care</p>
		<p>About not caring that I care</p>
		<p>Your name slowly carved itself deeper</p>
		<p>Into my soul</p>
