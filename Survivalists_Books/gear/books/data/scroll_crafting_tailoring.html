      Ze best way to make an armband iz to find shirts and cut ze arm so you can
      wrap it azround your arm. If youz get two armbandz youz got a double
      armband. You can embroider a pattern on a double armband to differentiate
      between other armbanz. Ragz and a sewing kit can embroider a flag for a
      flagpole.
