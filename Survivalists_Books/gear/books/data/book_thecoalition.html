    <title>On the Coalition</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <br />
    <p>
      I should start off by saying that not everything is perfect, and neither is this book. What we are using are a number of biased claims and reports,<br />
      along with documents left behind by the powers of this time and beyond. It was difficult to gather due to the age of this group and the fact that it<br />
      did not survive as far as many others. Some even attempted to stamp out its history. This makes true and full recollection of events difficult, and we<br />
      have pieces of its history missing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Coalition started with a man by the name of Zev Or. While we do not know much, we know he arrived on the island as many did in that time, those<br />
      early days of what would transform into our current world, before any of the things that plague our home even came to be. He arrived scared and unsure<br />
      of his surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would find friendship in the people of Jamestown while they were still located in scouts camp and the south, though we do not know much entirely we<br />
      know he and the woman who would become Jamestown's leader, Louella became very close, and as he made friends and allies, she gave him a gift. A gift that<br />
      came with great power. She gave him access to an armory that had been built and given to her by a now gone person whose name I have not been able to uncover.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not entirely know how he came across his members but he would have the people to arm with these weapons and body armor soon. The Coalition's second in<br />
      command Maus, A quiet and reclusive but extremely rude individual. Along with many others, a mentally unstable man called wolfen and hush, to name a few of<br />
      those names we've uncovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Skipping ahead to the part where we can glean a bit more information, Zev built his Coalition using this armory and his allies, to hunt not just Bandits<br />
      but Cannibals, which were a massive threat to the island at that point in time, there is another book speaking of their past too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually Jamestown would be forced from scouts camp by a horde of zombies that ran during the day, overwhelming it's defenders and forcing the survivors<br />
      to find a new home. By this time Louella had taken leadership and her relationship with Zev Or had grown closer. Both Coalition and Jamestown found a home<br />
      in the same castle. Jamestown castle, the second castle in the south. Atop a hill overlooking the stonington suburbs. Plenty of space and defenses.<br />
      Both groups would intertwine and share the same location.
    </p>
    <p>
      History gets a bit clearer, as more people arrived on the Island the castle grew into a power. With the Coalition and Jamestown combined they were the power in<br />
      the south, hunting down bandits and cannibals alike. The Coalition, like Jamestown, frequently chafed with Sanctuary. The only true settlement to the North at the<br />
      time, and one they considered to be full of weaklings and cowards. In turn the North thought of the south as Barbaric and quick to violence. Truth on both sides? Likely.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time in the castle Zev Or would take an active role in leading Jamestown with Louella, even taking charge of Jamestown during a period of time that<br />
      she'd left the town. During this period came about a man called Harold, who would later form Bastion. He lived in Jamestown and communicated commonly with Coalition<br />
      members, even working with them from time to time to help protect the town despite his refusal to talk. Zev Or and Harold became..friendly, of sorts. Though they<br />
      never became close friends and their relationship would later sour.
    </p>
    <p>
      They also made allies with a group known only as The Brotherhood, led by a man named Artem, though the Brotherhood would have disagreements with Jamestown later.<br />
      The coalition would start the process of building alliances with the new town of Blackstone, as well as talk closely with the Wardens and Keepers of Oceanville during<br />
      these times. Most of the south, while tense, was peaceful and focused towards the Cannibal threat.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the Coalition would begin facing scrutiny. Brutal methods to kill Bandits and Cannibals lowered their reputation in the eyes of many, as they'd sometimes<br />
      overstep bounds or attack people on mere suspicion. They'd later collaborate with the town of Blackstone to capture and execute an extremely dangerous Cannibal<br />
      known only as Jester, who had a confirmed kill count of twenty five living people, and likely many more unconfirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold and one Sheriff Kirkman would participate as members of the Jamestown Sheriff's department, as would many other members of Jamestown, including Louella.<br />
      Who had returned from her trip away days before and accused zev or of taking control from her, despite her request for him to do it in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though not an extreme betrayal, it was one nonetheless as she slandered him. Though they maintained a very close relationship I would say this event began the fast<br />
      decline from Cannibal hunters to Tyrants, both in the Islands eye and in the Coalition's actions. This event, combined with words Jester spoke to the Coalition before his<br />
      execution, likely are what Incensed and set the man further down the path he'd already been taking. He went to Blackstone and accused them of harboring Jester's Protege.<br />
      He brought with him Louella and a number of his people. They returned after going down there, with a massive disagreement taking place and almost a fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time, Zev Or and Louella, while having issues with each other, had settled on wanting one person in particular dead. This person was one of Louella's friends,<br />
      and Louella had begun accusing her friend of being friends with a cannibal. I do not know much as the history is lost, but they would trick this person into a meeting and<br />
      then execute them. This is what would lead Harold and two other members leaving Jamestown, those three would eventually align with a number of people living in stonington<br />
      harbor and form Bastion, in the castle Arcadia now sits in.
    </p>
    <p>
      From what we know, this led to a tense situation. The coalition and Jamestown continued hunting Cannibals and Mutants, but they had made several enemies, with a group <br />known as the Underground in Oceanville,
      who we sadly don't have much information on as of yet. They'd made relations tense if not hostile with blackstone, and they now had Bastion almost right next to them.<br />
      Growing fast into a band of twenty people,
    </p>
    <p>
      Their only upside with the situation is that Bastion had made mistakes. Weakening themselves with a five leader system, where two of the five were corrupt and the fifth,<br />
      Harold himself was mute. The others slowly grew disillusioned as Bastion faced a somewhat constant attack by Bandits, and survivors who left Bastion disgruntled with its<br />
      corrupt leader. Though the Coalition had several contacts with Bastion a handful were of it attempting to fight some of the bandits attacking it and even aid Bastion despite<br />
      its differences, while in other occasions it tried to slip spies into Bastion, which failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blackstone itself was facing bandit attacks and slowly falling apart on its own anyway. Not much of why is known to me, but this tied up two of the Coalition's biggest<br />
      worries anyhow. All that was left was Oceanville. Specifically a faction IN Oceanville, the Underground. Reports on whether another group was involved or not are sparse,<br />
      but needless to say they began to war with each other. During one of the opening fights a figure that would later be called Doll Face would appear, something people<br />
      called paranormal, and interrupted the fighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was...specified to this Author that a leak from within the Coalition said it's true purpose was to find and deal with paranormal entities, which makes its focus on Dollface<br />
      and the Temple in the midst of a war a bit more explainable, if you ask this Author. The war with the Underground ended in a Coalition defeat, with Zev Or taking a<br />
      grenade detonation from them point blank and the Coalition scattering. They left Jamestown and fled to a safezone to treat Zev Or's injuries, but much of its power was...spent.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time the South went through several events, the Wolfpack lead by one Jimmy Moncler would arrive and they would forge a seemingly unbreakable friendship with Bastion.<br />
      The Wolfpack would wage a war against an army of cannibals known as the Skull Horde and groups like the Patriots, who pretended to be protectors but truthfully housed <br />
      remnants of the Skull horde and acted as bandits would appear. Two such groups came into being. Eventually The southern groups sans Jamestown and the two groups harboring<br />
      cannibals and bandits would attempt to make a Southwide alliance with each other. This would sour due to corruption and plotting within the Underground.
    </p>
    <p>
      This soured alliance revealed a threat to the people of Jamestown, which Bastion and the Wolfpack would take to Louella, beginning the process of mending the rift<br />
      between the two southern castles. A process that would also sour due to bad decisions between all three groups. While these events were happening, we do not know <br />
      exactly WHAT happened to the Coalition, but it's my belief that it began to fragment, having seen their charismatic and (previously) seemingly invulnerable leader<br />
      injured so severely, along with facing their first true defeat. I have come to believe these events led to severe demoralization and they fragmented.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Coalition would later return after an attack on the Keeper's bridge by one of the two fake protector groups, this group had...became extremely religious and<br />
      begun worshiping an ancient Egyptian god? The second group was killed by the Wolfpack before these events, with support from Bastion and other groups. During the<br />
      attack on the Bridge, Commander Zev Or would reveal himself with what were most likely the last members of the Coalition aside from him and Maus. They would fight<br />
      the attackers at the bridge and defend it while the Wolfpack went to their base to destroy it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The battle would result in the Coalition forces being almost entirely killed, many of its last warriors laying down their lives against the strange cultists'<br />
      continued attack. We know that a small number had survived, among them Zev Or and Maus. They held a conversation with Harold of Bastion and several other members<br />
      of the town, which led to one fighting a Keeper and promptly planting brass knuckles on him in the fighting ring. From here we once more begin to lose much detail.<br />
      The coalition looked for its home back among Jamestown, but Louella refused them, and Zev Or. An argument between them fracturing the two groups' relationships permanently.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the time between this and the next events, the Wolfpack would work closely with the Coalition to kill multiple groups of bandits and threats to the Isle, growing<br />
      a close friendship with them and it's leader growing to admire Zev Or. During this time the great tension between South and North Began, the day after Harold of<br />
      Bastion and Drake of Jamestown attempted to create a new southern alliance without the issues of the old. With Riders of Portland and Jamestown speaking of war with<br />
      each other, though the tension seemingly was started primarily by Jamestown according to some reports, and others state that it was started by the Riders.<br />
      Regardless, the Coalition played a small role here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jamestown would attempt to bring the Coalition to its side, sending Harold of Bastion to talk with Zev Or and Maus, as Harold's ties with Zev hadn't been quite as shattered.<br />
      Supposedly the talks went peaceful but the Coalition would not return to help the town that spurned them, instead stating they hoped Jamestown fell.<br />
      Jimmy and the Wolfpack would follow the Coalition in this, while Harold of Bastion felt that remaining true to his words and alliances was important,<br />
      and stuck with Jamestown. Driving a wedge between the two friends. The Coalition would mostly do its own thing quietly for a time, moving to a boat in the far<br />
      north at Portland’s Harbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the original Collective formed in Portland, led by Warlock and made of humans, tensions across the island rose within and between groups. We know not much of what<br />
      happened in those times, but there WERE rumors that the Coalition supported the Collective forces there and Warlock. Why they would support a man who would later create<br />
      the Alpha Mutant and Bioflower and attempt to wage war on humanity, when their original goal was to protect people is beyond me. Perhaps they had been lied to or this Warlock<br />
      was not as far gone back then as he was when he began the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall the end of the Coalition would come quietly and suddenly, with Zev Or walking into Jamestown and making demands to be given his home there back and them refusing,<br />
      before being killed in the town and the Coalition shattering once more, and this time permanently. Maus vanished into hiding, to re-emerge once much later with a figure<br />
      calling himself the Grey Ghost, who would also vanish immediately after with Maus. Neither would be seen again and the only time voices cried 'Glory to the Coalition'<br />
      which was it's rallying cry, was either in mocking, or as a codeword between members of Bastion, who had differing views on the controversial group among themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall this Author thinks the tale of the Coalition that we have is...a strange one. Much is left out, motivations and beliefs along with large gaps in activity and history.<br />
      What you take from this history is up to you, and with how controversial it is I will keep my beliefs on this to myself.
