    <p>
      Where there are the hungry, there shall be food, where there is the cold there shall be warmth, where there are animals, they shall be protected. For no death shall be easy, conscious must be clear, waste not, want
      not. It is our duty as Knights to preserve the lands upon which we walk, for we are not its owner, only Shepard. This is the oath that binds us all, a respect for life and land.
