      If you have found these texts then you are either a very dangerous person or you are in grave danger. contained within these sacred pages are secrets not known to most mere mortals, only those who would consider
      themselves true warriors with the competence to eat their enemies after victory shall understand. chapter one. prey There are many types of prey on the Isle (some braver than others) but my personal favourite is
      the human survivor. Not only do most of them possess the courage needed to survive the end of days in their hearts, but some of them are actually rather intelligent, which makes their brain a prized delicacy into
      the bargain. The warrior should choose to stick to a diet consisting of brave and viscious prey. I have eaten them all and ranked the properties gained from ingestion as following. .Human- strength & focus and a
      resistance to being knocked unconscious. <br />
      Bear- eating these will make you braver than anyone you know, also puts hair on your chest. .<br />
      Wolf- These are the next most intelligent prey next to humans. In case you are not smart enough to catch a human these can be a good choice. Animals such as chickens, cows, pigs and sheep should be avoided as they
      have adverse traits which will make you weak and emotional, and therefore putting you in the sights of the apex predators that roam the Isle.

      Chapter 2 - Meal Prep Ever since switching my diet for optimum health benifits, I have been searching for ways to spice up my meals and keep it fresh and interesting. Here Is my original meal plan suitable for all.
      <br />
      Monday- sausages. Made by taking a handful of your latest victim grinding it up and then filling his/her intestines up with the meat and smoking over a fire for a tasty nutritious meal. <br />
      Tuesday- leg of sam (or whatever their name was) This is a hearty meal on the second day of the week, seperate the leg at the hip using a sharp knife to cut through that pesky connective tissue and then do the same
      at the knee and smoke in the fire the same as the sausage. <br />
      Wednesday- eyeball soup. You will need to keep your eyes sharp for spotting those crafty survivors, nothing better than this soup, first you remove the eyes of your prey, then combine their entire head and a little
      piece of steak together in a bowl to create this tasty dish.<br />
      Thursday- intestine spaghetti, this dish is a life saver if you are entertaining but forgot to stock up on pasta, simply take you're preys intestines', cut them into noodle sized strips and combine them with a cut
      of meat and voila. <br />Friday- eating is cheating on a friday, today is booze and cocaine all day simply empty a bottle of booze into a plastic bottle so that your spouse doesn't suspect that you are an alcoholic
      and you are good to go, the booze will keep you happy and full all day.
      <br />
      Saturday- You wake up outside your house rough at 4pm ready to make another great meal only for your spouse to start nagging that you've been fucked up for 3 days and that is now Monday again. simply repeat this
      diet every week for best results.

      Chapter 3- The greens The Greens are the most interesting prey, off the menu to humans as they are harmful to their digestive tract due to the high levels of radiation they gather while the feed in the biozones
      like broccoli people. They can eat anything on the warriors menu and more, most notably the mutated wolves and alpha mutants. This food chain advantage allows the green warrior access to potential levels of rage
      and savagery unavailiable to the humans. However some Green folk scavange their meals from the insect-like head crabs that scuttle around the bio zones and inadvertently gain the stupidity of their meal. Noted
      insane behaviours of these individuals are that of mutating in such a way that they are able to stomach the filth that the humans ate before the end of dayz, "foods" such as marmite, marshmallow fluff and cookies.
      Those that eat such trash will surely lose their edge, and inevitably end up at my house for dinner but not as a guest. Stay Smart. Eat right. Be better. Fisher
