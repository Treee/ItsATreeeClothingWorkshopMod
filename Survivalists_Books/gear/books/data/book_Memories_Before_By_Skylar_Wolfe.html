      I sit and recount memories of the long past, of times when life seemed so impossible. Looking back now, life was so genuine and simple back then. These are a gathering of my memories as far back as I can remember.
      A time before all this.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of my first memories was when I started construction of The Salty Cougar Tavern. A hectic place, but, always a story to tell. One such memory is of Warlock, a threat and a mystery still to me. I was standing on
      the rooftop measuring some plank lines and I noticed an old man hiding behind one of our road posts, I decided to watch him. ( I would later know this man as Sir Locksley.) As I watched Him, I saw a thin tall man
      dressed in all black sporting a blue armband with a red shattered hexagon shape, it was the symbol of the Collective. At the time I had little knowledge of The Collective or Warlock. I watched Sir Locksley jump out
      from behind the post dressed in full knight armor swinging some sort of sword or giant blade of sorts, I'll never forget what he yelled as he began to chase off this Warlock fellow down the road. " Warlock you
      little shit get back here!!!" and off they ran down the road. I do not know what happened after that. Another mystery.

      On another occasion, I met a man named Lucas. That was all he ever said, Lucas. Lucas for yes, Lucas for no. He was a strange fellow but seemed helpful at this point. It was Lucas who first introduced me to "The
      Ghosts" in a time even before The Arbiters. Wow, so much time has passed and so much now seems so far away locked in some sort of time capsule. Anyways, The Ghosts were a faction of bandits and cannibals from what
      I was told, I was very worried about upsetting them, but their leader would come by and request I sing a song every time they stopped by, and even brought up a grill from Oldfield to the Broken bridges. Mind you
      this was before Cars, so he had one of His prospects drag it up in his arms the whole way. Quite the trip I was told.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is hard to imagine I had this little place where no matter your faction or past, your present or issues, The Salty Cougar was a place where all that was left at the door. The thing is, even with minimal
      security, people respected that for the most part. Crazy to think.

      One evening that same man named Warlock came by with his group of The Collective and asked to spend the night as they were planning some sort of trip. I sat down to play a song by the campfire, A Thousand Years was
      the song. Warlock just sat quiet and said nothing no movement right up to the end of the song, then I swear I saw a single teardrop fall. He stood and motioned to his group, then they were off.
    </p>
    <p>
      A couple of weeks later, they stopped by again, and The same song was requested. I played it and sang, but still no real response. He just sat still and listened, then left. Something about the song perhaps He
      liked. Another Mystery.

      So much to try and remember, the great storms, people trying to survive after that, and lost loved ones. New beginnings. <br />
      Ha! Yes! Cougar Town!<br />
      That place was a riot of fun, hard times, and sorrow. <br />
      It's where I met Johnny. He was such a joy to have in my life then, I don't know what I'd do without all those people who influenced me and allowed me to grow into the person I am today. Dr. Wells, was a tough
      Aussie lady, at least I think she was Aussie. She was friendly efficient, and knew how to use a gun, my god that woman was a force to be reckoned with. Killian, my annoying adopted brother I suppose, I picked him
      up on the road and he stayed with us for a long time. I miss him. Our shop keeps Tim, and Joel, the guys who joined us when things got really bad.<br />
      Graylight, My Son, My pride and joy watching him grow, learn, to experience life without being forced to. My heart still breaks knowing how he was just erased from my world.

    <p>I want to remember everything, things feel out of place, like memories are fading, I think it's good to write these things down so I can come back and read them, so I don't forget where I came from.</p>
    <p>Where I came from, it was Oliver Walker who saved my life.</p>

      I will end this first chapter here. <br />
