    <title>The Wolves of Warren Cove: The Wolfpack</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <br />
    <p>
      Let’s start off with the basics on this band of survivors and former soldiers. It’s important to remember that not all of the facts of the time are available in these, especially with groups as old as this one,
      that fell so soon compared to others. We are lucky that this one in particular made enough splashes to be trace-able.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Wolfpack originally arrived on the Isle some time after the outbreak, before even the first winter had set in. A small band of former military soldiers and police officers led by one ‘Jimmy Moncler’ moved
      quickly into Warren Cove, setting up at first in the Police Station and moving about to gather supplies. We don’t know too much about their arrival aside from this, and that some time shortly after they arrived,
      one of the group Bastions council leaders, by the name of Brody would go down and meet with them, this meeting cemented a friendship between the two groups that persisted even during a conflict where they found
      themselves on opposing sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having solidified their position Warren, the Wolfpack began to reach out, calling for Volunteers to come to Warren Cove and join them, promising training and equipment, as well as beginning to patrol the island and
      talk with other groups. They’d recruit heavily and find friends in the Keepers at Oceanville bridge, among the Wardens in Oceanville, and even more in Bastion and its council, with Harold of Bastion becoming fast
      friends and a close ally to Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      They quickly began to participate in bandit and cannibal hunts, along with being instrumental to the destruction of several groups. Jimmy would find himself at odds with Jamestown’s Louella, which naturally caused
      their groups to chafe and argue from time to time though it wouldn’t quite come to fighting until much later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming to the Aid of both Bastion and the Keepers of Oceanville bridge during multiple attacks they cemented themselves as a band of well-intentioned, and well armed men for the most part. They’d find themselves at
      odds with their Neighbors in the Patrolmen as these men would consistently rob single and easy targets and claim otherwise, along with Jimmy Moncler’s statements being quite rude to him, and would later attack and
      destroy their base after they made an attack on Oceanville.
    </p>
    <p>
      During one of the attacks on Oceanville where both the handful of living Bastion members and Wolfpacks main force moved to help the Keepers, Jimmy Moncler would meet Commander Zev Or for the first time, along with
      a handful of the Coalition remnants, as by this time the Coalition had come into conflict with the Underground, another group based out of Oceanville that severely injured Commander Zev Or. Many of the Coalition
      troops would be injured or shot, with Jimmy leading the Wolfpack towards the place where these attackers had come from a band that had previously called themselves ‘The Patrolmen,’ though they’d recently begun
      claiming to worship ‘The Sun god Ra’ and had attacked the Keepers when one of them joked about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moncler and his wolves destroyed the base and the Faction, the first of several they would destroy. They would eventually, with Bastion as well, meet with the Riders of Portland, where according to Jimmy, a request
      was made of him by its leader, by the name of Hank ‘To Kill Louella of Jamestown,’ whether this is true or not…I cannot truly say. Either way this request would in the future lead to disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometime after the war with the Coalition and the Cannibals coming out of Ocean Ville ended the Skull Horde formed from both remnants of the Ocean Ville cannibals and a large number of the scattered and hunted
      southern cannibals, it quickly found itself locked into a deadly fight with both remnants of the handful of coalition troops active at the time due to internal issues, and the entire force of the Wolfpack which
      hammered into and quickly shattered the Skull Horde.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Wolfpack then began a mop up operation of its survivors which would lead it into direct conflict later with the first group to take the name of the Patriots, as a survivor of the Horde by the name of ‘Max’ had
      convinced its leader to let it in. It’s quite unfortunate that I don’t have the name of its leader in any notes or eye witness accounts I’ve been able to find. We’ll touch on this later.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Wolfpack’s Commander and Zev would become close allies during this period of time, working together at times to hunt cannibals, and bandits, even after the Coalition's weakening and exit from Jamestown. During
      a meeting held at the Wardens camp, with Jamestown, Bastion, Some members of the flagging and slowly falling keepers, and a handful of the Underground, in order to ease tensions and discuss matters, events fired
      off that would bring about the destruction of the Patriots.For Jamestown's leader, Louella, had brought her friend Hemlock to the meeting. At the time, he was known as a ‘Strange man that didn’t wear shoes, always
      wore a gasmask and spoke funny, and ran a body removal service that led to him being accused of being a cannibal,’ nowadays he’s known as the man who would become Warlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hemlock went missing during this meeting, and it was noticed a short time after, at which point the meeting split up to comb the surrounding area for him. The first to find Hemlock was the at the time mute and
      unspeaking Harold of Bastion, who found him held captive by one Max of the Patriots, formerly of the Skull Horde. Harold would keep Max occupied until members of all the factions slowly converged on them, and
      proceeded to take Max hostage and then execute him. Hemlock was free and back with Louella, and the group, made up of Wardens, Bastion, Wolfpack, and Underground would move to the patriots base to ambush its leader
      under the cover of a meeting. Instead of surrendering the man chose to go out with a fight, and was gunned down by the motley band, leading to the rest of the Patriots dissolving and falling apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometime later, with their ties strengthened the Wolfpack and many of the larger southern groups, excluding Jamestown and at first Bastion, formed a Southern Alliance with an acronym, this Alliance would be formed
      to deal with any threats that rose in the south, and also as a force to prevent any of the Northerners, who were quite disliked by those in the south, and vice versa, from getting eyes and grand plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bastion would be brought into the fold later, as at this point it had been steadily bleeding strength and on its last legs for a while now, with Harold of Bastion being the last councilor, and member remaining in
      it’s home castle, after attacks, betrayals, and corruption inside the council having had to be rooted out. Though after a handful of meetings it would be brought into the fold of the Alliance just in time for
      trouble to begin, for two members of the Underground had brought and forced a member of the Wolfpack of the name Max Pyke, into the temple. A band was sent to rescue him, consisting of Harold of Bastion and
      Siegfried of the Wolfpack, they entered the temple and brought him back to Jimmy, who had dispatched them in the first place because he had been forced to stay behind and handle the situation with Yuri Orlov, as
      apparently one of the members of the underground had been helping her brother, who’d entered the temple and gone insane prior, sacrifice people in order to try and bring him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yuri and the people of the Underground would quickly capture these two, and execute the sister while imprisoning the brother to try and ‘treat’ him, though Jimmy demanded the deaths of both for this action. This
      was one of the first signs that things were wrong inside of the alliance, it soon escalated during a late night meeting at Bastion during the winter, huddled inside one of the towers by a fire for warmth Moncler
      and Harold were discussing matters of the Alliance while awaiting Yuri.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yuri would finally show at the gate, with two silent masked guards, covered in the snow. Invited inside they would talk, with Yuri becoming increasingly agitated and making claims that he would wipe out the entire
      of Jamestown, including its people over its leader. He would leave shortly after, with Moncler and Harold discussing the matter and deciding to take it to Jamestown itself, both had issues with Jamestown, and one
      had a bad past with it that had led to the two groups avoiding each other. Yet both decided that they should warn the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      They would move through the winter night up to the castle, entering the town with Louella’s permission and talking to Louella and its residents who were awake so late at night, warning them of the meeting and the
      sudden turn the Underground seemed to be taking. This led to the parties being able to reconcile their differences for the most part, and the Wolfpack would find itself, if not particularly wanted, welcome at the
      least to Jamestown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day would have another meeting between Jimmy, Harold, and Yuri. This time in the Wolfpacks home. Where Yuri would reveal the truth of what was happening. The underground was undergoing a coup, for the
      younger brother of its leader had removed Yuri’s right hand man and most of those loyal to him, at the behest of a woman who had previously been quite close to Yuri, and then moved to him. He claimed they were
      traitors, and they began to whisper into Yuri’s ears. After the meeting that Night Orlov had met with his banished right hand man, and the situation became clear. Yuri told the two this at the meeting: That he
      would do what he could, but he was leaving the Underground entirely soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      This meeting itself led all three parties to the same conclusion: That the Southern Alliance was about to crack apart, Bastion had been reduced to one man, the Underground was weak and falling apart, and the
      Keepers were basically gone. The smaller bands and groups in the alliance had all fragmented as well, and only the Wardens and the Wolfpack themselves held strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two leaders would return to Jamestown, and inform its leader of the situation, along with Jimmy eventually informing other Alliance leaders. The younger brother of Yuri orlov and the woman manipulating him
      became hunted overnight, and while they weren’t found, they weren’t able to cause further damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      This winter led to ties between the Wolfpack and Jamestown strengthening, and by the time the Winter ended Jimmy Moncler and Harold of Bastion were better allies than ever. The Wolfpack would continue to grow
      strong, putting down groups that got in their way, and maintaining their hold on Warren cove after the winter ended, sometimes meeting with and working with Remnants of the Coalition during this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harold would one day come to the Wolfpack with an idea, not entirely original but changed. A new Southern Alliance, made primarily of Jamestown: Bastion: And the Wolfpack. Bastion was still greatly weakened, and
      had only recently begun taking in new members, but Harold Had maintained enough influence to put this together and meet with the leaders of these groups.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea itself was a collaboration: For Harold had been shown a bunker under the Stonington school by a member of Jamestown by the name of Drake, a crafty and very well liked man among its residents. The two would
      secure the bunker, talking throughout it and deciding to try and recreate the alliance. With a set of rules, balances, and checks in place that the two put together to prevent a situation like the underground from
      occurring again.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sounded like a good idea to Jimmy, and apparently to the other groups. As they and the Wardens all attended or sent a representative.The meeting did not particularly go well, and the outcome itself led to
      fracture. As before this time, Jimmy had decided to reveal to Louella what he had been asked of by Hank of the Riders, and this sent her into a rage, where when a rider by the name of Karl visited, she demanded to
      know if he’d been there, to which he claimed to have not. At the meeting, Jimmy claimed to Louella that Karl had indeed been there, and when Louella returned to Jamestown, she found Karl inside. She went into a
      rage, and kicked him out of the town screaming about what Jimmy had told her, later she, some members of the town, and Harold would chase someone spying on their conversation to the house of one of Bastions most
      wayward members. Where Karl himself sat there drinking beers with the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Threats, accusations, and a rather rude insinuation from Karl about Louella were thrown, What came from this, the next day, was a threat of war. Supposedly sent from Sanctuary, Jimmy at first sided with Louella.
      Though this changed quickly after a meeting between the two sides. Jimmy, Louella, and Harold, talking to the Riders and Sanctuary at Sunset cross. Louella revealed what Jimmy had told her, and the Riders claimed
      it was a lie. Jimmy would stay quiet during the meeting, and afterwards suddenly turn to the Riders, siding with them and claiming he’d never said that to Louella.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arguments abounded between him and Harold of Bastion about this decision, for Harold felt a man's word was one of the most important things, and was not willing to break an alliance he had just formed. Jimmy
      however, felt Louella was being reckless, putting them all in danger, and trying to get them killed. Because of this, combined with constant talks with Zev Or, who had by now come to hate Louella and Jamestown,
      He’d lost any good faith he’d gained in her by now, and simply wanted her dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two bands split, Bastion siding with Jamestown and the Wardens, Jimmy with the Riders and Sanctuary. No war ever came to be, even with tensions. And events such as Drake leaving Jamestown over Louella
      desperately trying to bring the Coalition back.. However, an event happened which both brought Bastion and the Wolfpack together again, and split them apart even further.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the men that had been redirected to Bastion due to Jamestown being full, led by a man named Hugo, launched a coup overnight. Bringing in Mercenaries who had also left Jamestown due to the attempt to bring
      back the Coalition, Harold stumbled onto them switching the codelocks to Hugo’s house, and was captured and banished from his own home. We will eventually touch more on this in the books on Duskar and Bastion, but
      for now. What’s important is that the only group to turn to aid Bastion was not Jamestown, or the Wardens. But the Wolfpack, Three days after the loss of the castle, The Mercenary, called so because we cannot find
      his name, and Hugo were offered a choice. Give back the castle, or War. The Wolfpack had decided to take it back for Harold, and had clothed and equipped him after most of his belongings had been stolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two turned it over to the Wolfpack, with Hugo coming in to return an ammo workbench to Harold under the promise of Peace, which would be broken by Jimmy against Harold’s wishes, together with a man by the name
      of Rick who had recently come back to the Island to rejoin Bastion. Harold was appalled at this and banished Rick from his group, while Jimmy simply said that if they’d let Hugo go scot free things like this would
      happen again. He offered to take Rick in. Calling Harold soft. The Mercenary would surrender the castle as well shortly after, walking up the road unarmed and informing them, though the Wolfpack this time honored
      Harold’s wishes, even though it was proven not six minutes later they had been right to want to punish the two. For when Jimmy walked into the home of his ally, the two were aghast at what they found. The castle
      had been ransacked, homes empty, greenhouses, flagpoles, fortifications and even common areas destroyed. It was almost entirely empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be revealed later that Hugo stole most of this to build the original town of Duskar, while the mercenary would go on to build a town of his own to the far north. Both towns were successful, though Duskar
      far more so, as it was able to hide the truth of it’s creation and Harold did not truly speak out against it at first, fearful as he was of losing his home once more now that he was alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Wolfpack and Harold would split for good this time, and while they would talk occasionally, their relationship was never truly repaired. They would continue to work with the Coalition and Zev Or until Zev’s
      death at the hands of Jamestown, making good friends with the P.A.L.F, a relatively new group that grew large amounts of weeds and had a grudge against Jamestown themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, they would attack Jamestown together, The Wolfpack, P.A.L.F, and Coalition Remnants looking for revenge over Zev. Arrayed against them were Drakes Bandits, who had formed recently in stonington and led
      by Drake, who was formerly of Jamestown and would later not only lead one of the most successful bandit groups out there, but also become the Black Palms true leader, Jamestown itself, headed by Louella and her
      recently established second in command Steven, Harold, who didn’t even know about the attack when he showed up and joined in the fighting to the best of his at the time minimal ability, the Betrayed who had
      recently returned to the Isle, And a small band of independent rangers who would join late but help clear the remnants. It’s possible these were some of the original pathfinders, but I cannot find any surefire
      notes, journals, or statements on the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      This battle would spell the end for the so far successful Wolves, as they had finally met their match in the form of multiple groups being at the castle, some by coincidence and some having come to help, when he
      attacked. The P.A.L.F and Wolfpack were slaughtered, with a handful of losses on the defending side, aside from Drake's band who sallied out around the back and suffered more casualties than anyone else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy Moncler was horribly injured later in the fight, and while he’d speak over the radio from time to time, was not much seen, and the Wolfpack faded away quickly, eventually leaving the Island altogether aside
      from a member named Shane, who’d briefly arrive on the Island and reminisce about old times with other friends from the past, looking for and saddened by the deaths and disappearances of his brothers, he would
      eventually leave the Island himself. Even if the Wolfpack would eventually be proven right, in their accusations of Louella being a Cannibal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tale of the Wolfpack is a somewhat sad one, in this Author's opinion. They were brutal indeed, and committed acts that would make some people sick to this day, but they had started well intentioned, as had so
      many others, and eventually separated from all of their closest allies one by one until they fell at the end. They did hold true to the bonds of Wolves, turning to help their friend even after they had ended up on
      opposing sides from him. Some may live to this day, but if so finding them has proven to be quite the challenge for this Author, I suspect they’ve all long since left the Isle.
