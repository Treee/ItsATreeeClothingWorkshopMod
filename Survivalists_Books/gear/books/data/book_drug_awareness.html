      To whom it may concern, I write this account to document the story for all
      thers the horrors of drugs and their effects on the human body. The
      biggest cause for concern is conterfeit/tained drugs. These fakes will
      cause serious injury to addicts or abusers. For those that have
      photosensitivity, I recommend you not risk your life.

    <p>Nicotine</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Cigarette's and Cigar's nowadays are rolled with refined tobacco; no extra
      additives. A finely rolled cigar commands attention and bolsters charisma.
      Some will notice a slight dry mouth along with an adreneline rush. This
      extra flow of blood allows for dilated pupils which makes the world seem
      more vibrant. As one of the lesser narcotics, the dependency is moderate
      as poses less risk than zeds.

    <br />
    <p>Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Arguably one of the most dangerous narcotics. Legends are told of a
      madness that manifests from the onset of your first puff. A sweet smelling
      joint is a trap beckoning weak willed individuals. Those enthralled by the
      madness report cotton mouth and ravenous appetites. The world becomes
      vibrant beyond compare and some are said to lose their minds in the
      beauty. Use at your own risk, lest the madness root itself in you.

    <p>Methamphetamine</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Originally developed as an anti-depressant and diet medication, the
      mood-elevating effect allowed for extensive use in millitary application.
      At the onset of the apocalypse, the only way to combat the walking dead
      was to never let your guard down. Without proper manufacturing facilities
      and tools, post apocalyptic meth is riddled with many deterrents. Long
      term users report blurred vision, spontaneous bleeding, vomiting, auditory
      hallucinations, and the ability to fight like an animal.

    <p>Bath Salts</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      In the peak of civilization pre apocalypse, we had the luxury of bathing
      without worry. These baths were magnificent and moreso if salts were
      dissolved into the water. Turns out these salts also pack a punch when
      ingested. Sometimes you want to eat the face off an enemy while bleeding
      from your eyes and I can't stop you. Side effects are vomiting, bleeding
      from the ears, blurred vision, auditory hallucinations, loss of color
      contrast, and a familiar urge to rage.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD)</p>
    <br />
    <p>
      A mainly hallucinogenic drug with symptoms that includes visual and
      auditory hallucinations. The onset is quick and lasts for a significant
      amount of time. There is a chance that a bad trip will never let you
      return to normal; beware.
