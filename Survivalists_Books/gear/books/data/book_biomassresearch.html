    <title>On Biomass And It's Connection To Mutants</title>
  </head>

    <p>
      Hello reader! This is the basis of knowledge on the Biomass and Mutant relationship that I've gathered so far. <br />
      It's the combination of research and information from multiple sources and me trying to put it together. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      First things first, it's important to note several key facts in that the Biomass and Alpha Mutant flesh were in past extremely similiar, <br />
      they still are today, but supposedly the Alpha Mutants in past were not only much more durable, but made of a Biomass that looked very close to the current Biomass.<br />
      They at some point evolved and lost a lot of that durability, though encounters increased after so it's possible these more biomass-like forms <br />
      required much more energy to move and so weren't as active, which is why the evolution shed a lot of that in order to allow them more mobility, this is my current belief. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It's been mentioned multiple times by a handful of my sources, who claim to have talked with Observers, Warlock, and even <br />
      Alpha Mutants that standard mutant life is connected to each other by a hive-mind known as the collective, It's my firm belief <br />
      that the Half Mutants or Hybrids, as they're called are not. It's claimed that any Mutants that die still live on in the collective, <br />
      and it's theorized that depending on some circumstances Humans were drawn into the collective as minds. <br />
      There are claims that all mutant Biomass is connected to the collective, aside from the Hybrids. <br />
      Which is a scary thought, every Mutant Flower, Stalk, and Pod reports back to the main Hivemind and is in contact with it. <br />
      Who knows how intelligent it is? One survivor theorized that the stationary biomass serves as both a signal booster and databank for their collective, while I've had others disagree entirely.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      Though most believe whole-heartedly that the Biomass is connected to the collective the same as the Alpha Mutants, Observers, and mutated wildlife.<br />
      According to Eyewitness accounts and the handful of dedicated researchers and information gatherers on the Isle I was able to talk to, <br />
      the Observers are dozens of minds put together in one body, and there were cases of a singular mind coming to the front to speak to an individual, <br />
      those I've only had this mentioned offhandedly by a single source, who I've been unable to reach or even contact for further comment. <br />
      Back to the Biomass, there are reports of people stabbing it, blowing it up, and shooting it to no effect. <br />
      It also according to many people I've asked, stinks of rotting flesh. Though I've not gotten close enough to ask myself. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Another theory is that the Biomass serves as an incubation chamber for newly mutating creatures, like the dogs or Head Spiders. <br />
      Though I've had one rather...grim individual claim that the skulls present as the Head Spiders that blow people up, <br />
      are the remains of everyone that's died on the island that the Biomass and mutants can get it's hands on. <br />
      I've also managed to get a few statements saying that the Biomass puts out a large amount of heat, enough to actually overheat and make humans sweat, <br />
      if not hurt them through extended contact. Overall I think it's safe the say that the Biomass is dangerous even if immobile, <br />
      due to it's connection to other mutants. For all we know we're being watched through it even now. <br />
