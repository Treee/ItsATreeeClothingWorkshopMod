    <title>A book on Herbology and Alchemy</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <br />
    <p>I should start off by saying that not everything is perfect, and neither is this book. What we are using are a number of biased claims and reports,<br /></p>
    <p>
      The Alchemy Society was created in 2006 (Year 3 since the fall) as a not-for-profit organization led by Master Alchemists Luna Pan and Clayton Collier Sr.<br />
      Both have dedicated thousands of hours into researching the properties of herbs and their medicinal and practical uses on the Island. The Society will train<br />
      and assist any survivor showing an interest in learning herbology and alchemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Autumn of Year 3, the Society came together as a faction and created an armband and flag to show their affiliation to the craft and their dedication in<br />
      serving the people of the Island. It consists of a black symbol on a white background. The symbol is a circle with plants along the perimeter and two crescents<br />
      top and bottom. In the middle of the circle is a mortar and pestle, the keystone to the alchemical craft. The faction consists of two bases. Luna's is located<br />
      at coordinates x5642 y5388. A small compound with some greenhouses and planters and some interesting taxidermied animals from the island. She also offers a few<br />
      donation tents and lockers for survivors to take from when they are in need. She also has a couple cabins that she allows survivors use from time to time.<br />
      There is a well on site.

      Clayton is based out of Camp Bellevue, the only place he has lived since he came to the Island in the Spring of Year 2. This campus is spread out over the area<br />
      from the top of the mountain to the shores of Lady Lake. Camp Bellevue has a compound that is open to the public and a good place to take shelter from the occasional<br />
      bears and wolves that wander into camp from time to time. There are numerous lockers, fridges and tents containing gear, food, ammo and weapons for any weary traveler<br />
      who comes by. There is also a potbellied stove to use. Above the compound is the grow area consisting of eight planters and a tower to gain a good vantage point<br />
      and observe the Society territory. Clayton uses three potbellied stoves in this area for the arduous task of drying the herbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the hill, past a lone cabin sits another large compound next to Lady Lake. Named Lady Lake Gardens and Rest, It consists of an old Pub and a large structure which<br />
      acts as the Guild House. The grounds are open to the public as is the bottom floor of the Guild House. The upper floor is for Society members only. A greenhouse and a<br />
      donation tent lie within the compound. Although Society members may live within the campus at either site, the Society prefers its members to be integrated within other<br />
      factions, so that we can better disseminate our knowledge and skills throughout the island. At the time of this writing, we have members of the Alchemy Society embedded<br />
      in Black Lake (Arcadia), Cliffside, Altar, Threepwood (The Cooperative) and Westbrook (The Ryan Brothers).
    </p>
    <p>Herbology</p>
    <p>
      There are eight different herbs that can be grown on the island. Their seed packets can be found throughout the Island. Usually on picnic tables and in greenhouses.<br />
      Most packets contain four seeds. You can plant the seeds in greenhouses, dirt plots or planters. Some plants are troublesome to harvest in the greenhouses and plots,<br />
      but everything can be grown in a planter. Mint, Green Amanita and Dock have been basically impossible to harvest in a greenhouse. Planters can be crafted using nails and planks.<br />
      Experiment with the number of nails and you may save a few. The planter box gains the best yield. The trick is to refresh the dirt each time you plant. <br />
      Water generously and use fertilizer to give the plants the nutrients they need. Lime works best, but plant material will work in a pinch. Some plant diseases<br />
      can kill the plants before they can be harvested. Spraying each plant with disinfectant spray will keep them healthy and hale. You can even revive a plant that<br />
      is struggling with the spray. Spray when the plants are young.
    </p>
    <p>Drying and Grinding</p>
    <p>
      The harvested plants need to be dried out and ground into powder. A Mortar and Pestle is the tool to use for grinding. Plants can be placed on the smoking/drying<br />
      section of the fireplace and will dry fairly quickly. Be careful when you place them on the fire, it only takes about 2 and a half minutes for them to dry and if<br />
      you leave them on too long, they will burn and be useless.
    </p>
    <p>Becoming an Alchemist</p>
    <p>
      Anyone who is interested in herbology and alchemy and want to join the Society can do so by contacting Luna or Clayton to get started. Acquire a Mortar and Pestle<br />
      and start collecting seeds. Your first task as an initiate is to grow all eight seeds and collect two full piles of powdered herbs. This task introduces the initiate<br />
      to the rigors and dedication it takes to learn the craft. Once this is complete, you will become a member of the Society and we will start to teach you a recipe and<br />
      other secrets and skills of the craft.
