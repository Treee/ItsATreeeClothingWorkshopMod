    <title>A book on Herbology and Alchemy</title>

    <br />
    <p>
      The Alchemy Society was created in 2006 (Year 3 since the fall) as a not-for-profit organization led by <br />
      Master Alchemists Luna Pan and Clayton Collier Sr.Both have dedicated thousands of hours into researching <br />
      the properties of herbs and their medicinal and practical uses on the Island.
    </p>
    <p>The Society will train and assist any survivor showing an interest in learning herbology and alchemy.</p>
    <p>
      In Autumn of Year 3, the Society came together as a faction and created an armband and flag to show <br />
      their affiliation to the craft and their dedication in serving the people of the Island. It consists of a <br />
      black symbol on a white background. The symbol is a circle with plants along the perimeter and two crescents<br />
      top and bottom. In the middle of the circle is a mortar and pestle, the keystone to the alchemical craft.
    </p>
    <p>
      The faction consists of two bases. Luna's is located at coordinates x5642 y5388. A small compound with some <br />
      greenhouses and planters and some interesting taxidermied animals from the island. She also offers a few<br />
      donation tents and lockers for survivors to take from when they are in need. She also has a couple cabins <br />
      that she allows survivors use from time to time. There is a well on site.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clayton is based out of Camp Bellevue, the only place he has lived since he came to the Island in the Spring <br />
      of Year 2. This campus is spread out over the area from the top of the mountain to the shores of Lady Lake. <br />
      Camp Bellevue has a compound that is open to the public and a good place to take shelter from the occasional<br />
      bears and wolves that wander into camp from time to time. There are numerous lockers, fridges and tents containing <br />
      gear, food, ammo and weapons for any weary traveler who comes by. There is also a potbellied stove to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above the compound is the grow area consisting of eight planters and a tower to gain a good vantage point and<br />
      observe the Society territory. Clayton uses three potbellied stoves in this area for the arduous task of drying <br />
      the herbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the hill, past a lone cabin sits another large compound next to Lady Lake. Named Lady Lake Gardens and Rest, <br />
      It consists of an old Pub and a large structure which acts as the Guild House. The grounds are open to the public <br />
      as is the bottom floor of the Guild House. The upper floor is for Society members only. A greenhouse and a donation <br />
      tent lie within the compound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Society members may live within the campus at either site, the Society prefers its members to be integrated <br />
      within other factions, so that we can better disseminate our knowledge and skills throughout the island. At the time <br />
      of this writing, we have members of the Alchemy Society embedded in Black Lake (Arcadia), Cliffside, Altar, Threepwood <br />
      (The Cooperative) and Westbrook (The Ryan Brothers).
    </p>
    <p>Herbology</p>
    <p>
      There are eight different herbs that can be grown on the island. Their seed packets can be found throughout the <br />
      Island. Usually on picnic tables and in greenhouses. Most packets contain four seeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can plant the seeds in greenhouses, dirt plots or planters. Some plants are troublesome to harvest in the <br />
      greenhouses and plots, but everything can be grown in a planter. Mint, Green Amanita and Dock have been basically <br />
      impossible to harvest in a greenhouse. Planters can be crafted using nails and planks. Experiment with the number <br />
      of nails and you may save a few.
    </p>
    <p>
      The planter box gains the best yield. The trick is to refresh the dirt each time you plant. Water generously and <br />
      use fertilizer to give the plants the nutrients they need. Lime works best, but plant material will work in a pinch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some plant diseases can kill the plants before they can be harvested. Spraying each plant with disinfectant spray <br />
      will keep them healthy and hale. You can even revive a plant thatvis struggling with the spray. Spray when the <br />
      plants are young.
    </p>
    <p>Drying and Grinding</p>
    <p>
      The harvested plants need to be dried out and ground into powder. A Mortar and Pestle is the tool to use for <br />
      grinding. Plants can be placed on the smoking/drying section of the fireplace and will dry fairly quickly. <br />
      Be careful when you place them on the fire, it only takes about 2 and a half minutes for them to dry and if you <br />
      leave them on too long, they will burn and be useless.
    </p>
    <p>Becoming an Alchemist</p>
    <p>
      Anyone who is interested in herbology and alchemy and want to join the Society can do so by contacting Luna or <br />
      Clayton to get started. Acquire a Mortar and Pestle and start collecting seeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your first task as an initiate is to grow all eight seeds and collect two full piles of powdered herbs. This task <br />
      introduces the initiate to the rigors and dedication it takes to learn the craft. Once this is complete, you will <br />
      become a member of the Society and we will start to teach you a recipe and other secrets and skills of the craft.
