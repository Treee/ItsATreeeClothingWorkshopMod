      Before I die, I'll ride the sky; I'll part the clouds like foam. I'll brand each star with the Rolling R, And lead the Great Bear home. I'll circle Mars to beat the cars, On Venus I will call. If she greets me fair
      as I ride the air, To meet her I will stall. I'll circle high—as if passing by— Then volplane, bank, and land. Then if she'll smile I'll stop awhile, And kiss her snow-white hand. To toast her health and wish her
      wealth I'll drink the Dipper dry. Then say, "Hop in, and we'll take a spin, For I'm a rider of the sky." Through the clouds we'll float in my airplane boat—

      Mary V flipped the rough paper over with so little tenderness that a corner tore in her fingers, but the next page was blank. She made a sound suspiciously like a snort, and threw the tablet down on the littered
      table of the bunk house. After all, what did she care where they floated—Venus and Johnny Jewel? Riding the sky with Venus when he knew very well that his place was out in the big corral, riding some of those
      broom-tail bronks that he was being paid a salary—a good salary—for breaking! Mary V thought that her father ought to be told about the way Johnny was spending all his time—writing silly poetry about Venus. It was
      the first she had ever known about his being a poet. Though it was pretty punk, in Mary V's opinion. She was glad and thankful that Johnny had refrained from writing any such doggerel about her. That would have
      been perfectly intolerable. That he should write poetry at all was intolerable. The more she thought of it, the more intolerable it became. Just for punishment, and as a subtle way of letting him know what she
      thought of him and his idiotic jingle, she picked up the tablet, found the pencil Johnny had used, and did a little poetizing herself. She could have rhymed it much better, of course, if she had condescended to
      give any thought whatever to the matter, which she did not. Condescension went far enough when she stooped to reprove the idiot by finishing the verse that he had failed to finish, because he had already overtaxed
      his poor little brain. Stooping, then, to reprove, and flout, and ridicule, Mary V finished the verse so that it read thus:

      "Through the clouds we'll float in my airplane boat— For Venus I am truly sorry! All the stars you sight, you witless wight, You'll see when you and Venus light! But then—I'm sure that I should worry!" Mary V was
      tempted to write more. She rather fancied that term "witless wight" as applied to Johnny Jewel. It had a classical dignity which atoned for the slang made necessary by her instant need of a rhyme for sorry. But
      there was the danger of being caught in the act by some meddlesome fellow who loved to come snooping around where he had no business, so Mary V placed the tablet open on the table just as she had found it, and left
      the bunk house without deigning to fulfill the errand of mercy that had taken her there. Why should she trouble to sew the lining in a coat sleeve for a fellow who pined for a silly flirtation with Venus? Let
      Johnny Jewel paw and struggle to get into his coat. Better, let Venus sew that lining for him! Mary V stopped halfway to the house, and hesitated. It had occurred to her that she might add another perfectly
      withering verse to that poem. It could start: "While sailing in my airplane boat, I'll ask Venus to mend my coat."

      Mary V started back, searing couplets forming with incredible swiftness in her brain. How she would flay Johnny Jewel with the keen blade of her wit! If he thought he was the only person at the Rolling R ranch who
      could write poetry, it would be a real kindness to show him his mistake. Just then Bud Norris and Bill Hayden came up from the corrals, heading straight for the bunk house. Mary V walked on, past the bunk house and
      across the narrow flat opposite the corrals and up on the first bench of the bluff that sheltered the ranch buildings from the worst of the desert winds. She did it very innocently, and as though she had never in
      her life had any thought of invading the squat, adobe building kept sacred to the leisure hours of the Rolling R boys. There was a certain ledge where she had played when she was a child, and which she favored
      nowadays as a place to sit and look down upon the activities in the big corral—whenever activities were taking place therein—an interested spectator who was not suspected of being within hearing. As a matter of
      fact, Mary V could hear nearly everything that was said in that corral, if the wind was right. She could also see very well indeed, as the boys had learned to their cost when their riding did not come quite up to
      the mark. She made for that ledge now. She had no more than settled herself comfortably when Bud and Bill came cackling from the bunk house. A little chill of apprehension went up Mary V's spine and into the roots
      of her hair. She had not thought of the possibilities of that open tablet falling into other hands than Johnny Jewel's. "Hyah! You gol-darn witless wight," bawled Bud Norris, and slapped Bill Hayden on the back and
      roared. "Hee-yah! Skyrider! When yo' all git done kissin' Venus's snow-white hand, come and listen at what's been wrote for yo' all by Mary V! Whoo-ee! Where's the Great Bear at that yo' all was goin' to lead home,
      Skyrider?" Then they laughed like two maniacs. Mary V gritted her teeth at them and wished aloud that she had her shotgun with her. A youth, whose sagging chaps pulled in his waistline until he looked almost as
      slim as a girl, ceased dragging at the bridle reins of a balky bronk and glanced across the corral. His three companions were hurrying that way, lured by a paper which Bud was waving high above his head as he
      straddled the top rail of the fence. "Johnny's a poet, and we didn't know it!" bawled Bud. "Listen here at what the witless wight's been a-writin'!" Then, seated upon the top rail and with his hat set far back on
      his head, Bud Norris began to declaim inexorably the first two verses, until the indignant author came over and interfered with voice and a vicious yank at Bud's foot, which brought that young man down forthwith.
      "Aw, le' me alone while I read the rest! Honest, it's swell po'try, and I want the boys to hear it. Listen—get out, Johnny! 'I'll circle high as if passing by, then—v-o-l—then vollup, bank, an' land—' Hold him
      off'n me, boys! This is rich stuff I'm readin'! Hey, hold your hand over his mouth, why don't yuh, Aleck? Yo' all want to wait till I git to where—" "I can't," wailed Aleck. "He bit me!" "Well, take 'im down an'
      set on him, then. I tell yuh, boys, this is rich—" "You give that back here, or I'll murder yuh!" a full-throated young voice cried hoarsely. "Here, quit yore kickin'!" Bill admonished. "Go on, Bud; the boys have
      got to hear it—it's rich!" "Yeh—shut up, Johnny! Po'try is wrote to be read—go on, Bud. Start 'er over again. I never got to hear half of it on account of Johnny's cussin'. Go on—I got him chewin' on my hat now.
      Read 'er from the start-off." "The best is yet to come," Bill gloated pantingly, while he held the author's legs much as he would hold down a yearling. "All set, Bud—let 'er go!" Whereupon Bud cleared his throat
      and began again, rolling the words out sonorously, so that Mary V heard every word distinctly:
