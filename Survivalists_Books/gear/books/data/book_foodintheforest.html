    <p>Dedicated to my Grandson; Waste Not, Want Not, and nature will provide <br /></p>
    <p>
      This is a simple recounting of recipes and food preparations I’ve used while camping and hunting. <br />
      By no means is this a comprehensive survival guide, nor is it a gourmand’s journey.<br />
      Just the simple writings of a modest hunter; I thank you for picking up this book.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      “Whatchagot Stew”<br />
      What’re we making stew out of? Well, whatcha got? Hunting will certainly keep you from starving, <br />
      but if you can make use of a pot on a cooking rack (if you don’t have a camping tripod,<br />
      you can manage one with a few short and long sticks) or an actual oven,<br />
      then stew can be the difference between eating and eating well.<br />
      You can use fresh or dried ingredients; in fact, the cooking process will break down <br />
      dried ingredients into a juicy broth that’ll help you hydrate as well as give you rich nutrients.<br />
      Combining two portions of meat makes a basic stew, but if you have vegetables,<br />
      a mixed stew can give some variety to your diet. And if you’re a vegetarian, <br />
      don’t worry; you can just use two portions of vegetables instead.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, I know you may be thinking that if you don’t have a garden, you won’t have <br />
      vegetables to work with. Not true! You can forage for vegetables. <br />
      It is time consuming, and you’ll want gloves to protect your hands while rooting around,<br />
      but it can pay off. Look for the same shrubs and bushes that you’d look to for sticks <br />
      and firewood; you may find berries and rosehips, which you can’t use for the stew, <br />
      but they’re a good snack while you keep looking! And I don’t recommend using rotting vegetables; <br />
      just leave them to be taken by the soil again.<br />

      “Poor Man’s Landjaeger”<br />
      The dried and smoked meats that hunters favored in Germany are a delight; we can’t quite do the same here,<br />
      but in the field, we can make a basic version. After you’ve taken your knife and quartered your kill,<br />
      the intestines can either be used for cordage or you can pack meat into them; you’ve already<br />
      done the hard work of chopping up the meat into portions so we can do this without a meat grinder.<br />
      These field-made sausages cook up quickly and can be an excellent way to pack your meat out.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember; waste not, want not. You can scrape the hides to make raw leather,<br />
      and even put together a tanning rack with rope and sticks (and as mentioned, <br />
      you can use the gut to make the rope if need be. Just clean it with your knife)<br />
      to place the hides on. A full rack just takes some lime to tan up; that may be the<br />
      hardest thing to find in the wild, so it can be best to take the hides and leather<br />
      home to cure it, but if you happen to keep gardening lime in your pockets, you can go right ahead!<br />
      Likewise, you can carve the bones into fishhooks with your knife while you’re waiting<br />
      for things to cook; they won’t last beyond a couple casts, but they’ll do the trick<br />
      for a bit as long as you bait them.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The last thing I’ll mention is this: wait for your shot. A quick and easy kill in<br />
      one shot saves you the trouble of chasing down a wounded animal. You’ll save ammo, <br />
      you’ll save energy, and you’ll save shoe leather. <br />
