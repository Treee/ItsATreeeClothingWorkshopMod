      Many factions rise, but few stand for long. In such an environment are the Riders of Portland accustomed and remain the vigilant exception. Founded before the Outbreak by the club’s current President and Vice
      President’s fathers, the name reveals the line of work: a motorcycle club. With a reputation spanning state-wide for their excellent bikes, the Riders enjoyed a level of street fame that came with the role. But
      underneath the grease and grub was an operation so pure that it embarrassed even the most experienced in the business - gunrunning, a trade bearing high risk with even higher reward, was a business in which the
      club dominated. With the intent of having a charter in each U.S state, they were on the road to achieving such a goal. By 2003, the club boasted 20 charters in a respective state and was on the way to gaining a
      nationwide presence. But like the rest of the world, the charters did not remain in contact after the phone lines ceased to exist, and thus the club president Hank has taken on the burden of balancing operations on
      Deer Isle with searching for remnants of those with the black and red patch on their backs.

      Between eluding the police’s watchful eye and maintaining a legitimate business, the Riders tackled with a rival club based in Stonington - The Death Angels, a name paradoxical to their successes. The two exchanged
      minor blows to each other’s operations; a few hundred thousand dollars of ammunition lost here, weapons worth several million tossed there - it was not until the first few days of the outbreak that the clubs
      engaged in what can only be classed as a war. The Riders of Portland emerged victorious, and for the first time in an age were they without a major competitor - but then came the issue of finding business during
      the apocalypse. At least, they thought it was going to be an issue - until the undead began expanding at a rate that almost guaranteed repeat business of weaponry and ammunition. In such a world are the Riders
      so... indelicate.

      Before long, settlements of survivors became established on the isle but only few survived the test of time. One that showed promise was the town of Sanctuary, a place with numbers to show and a security force to
      defend. Sanctuary became a hub for gathering and commerce, which presented the Riders with an opportunity to innovate. Meeting with the town mayor, Ron Swanson, they began a mutually-beneficial relationship - the
      Riders would protect the town with both their reputation and arms, if an attack were to happen, and in return they maintain a presence in the town to attract vendors. Over a period of months, both club and town had
      become close friends, and the Riders were a steady supplier for not only the citizen’s weapons and ammunition, but also many other enclaves on the isle.

      The fable goes that Sanctuary stood the test of time, but not the test of the new world’s threats. After the town dissipated, the Riders returned north and their presence became less noticeable upon the isle. The
      Vice-President, Karl, was left to look after the charter whilst Hank searched the various states where other charters were formed for any surviving members.

      Even though the charter was not as prominent as it had been, the time was not wasted with idle hands. They had secured one of the few functioning machines capable of producing resources that enabled them to craft
      guns by hand. Such a market they had not endeavoured to enter - the I.R.A were more than adequate suppliers, but they had been silent for a long time. It was time to expand into new territory, and this downtime
      presented the perfect opportunity to learn the new trade.

      It was nearly 7 months later did Hank return. By then, Karl had established a settlement of their own in the south known as Steel Valley and was selling hand-made weapons and ammunition to the public once more.
      There were even rumours that Steel Valley had affiliated with S.T.A.G. Industries only to rip them off, but nothing was confirmed. Upon his arrival, Hank took on the mantle of leading the club into a familiar
      direction once more, with an even higher focus placed upon becoming suppliers of quality goods for the isle.
    </p>
    <p>
      By 2007, the Riders of Portland asserted themselves as reliable suppliers of ammunition for various merchants across the isle. They integrated a blacksmith into their rank to assist with the production of brass,
      which subsequently allowed them to become the cheapest supplier available in the market. It was during this period that high-powered ammunition fell to only ¾ of a nail per round from their L&S affiliated vendor,
      Broken Arrow Outfitters, which was the lowest price recorded in comparison to other vendors at the time. It would seem that the only factors which have changed for the club is the currency, and no more need to pay
      off the police. And now, with tow trucks being sighted upon the isle once more, the club has come full-circle, only counter-clockwise.

      It has been 3 years since the outbreak. The Riders have survived fights for their belongings against bandits, as well as two wars against the infamous mutant scourge. A question often asked is why they are never
      seen on bikes, to which the answer is one that surprises the more innocent of mind. Money staved away prying police eyes for a time, but it was the actions of a corrupt department in the south that stole their
      prized motorcycles. During a raid to take back what was stolen, the police destroyed their belongings - an act which the club responded by taking their possessions in whole.
