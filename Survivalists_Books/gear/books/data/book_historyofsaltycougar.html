    <p>
      This is the Origin Story of The Salty Cougar Tavern by Skylar Wolfe. <br /><br />
      History has ways of being lost to time and lack of knowledge. I hope to tell the story as best as I can before it is too late and it is washed into nothingness. <br />
      I woke up on Deer isle Alone with only a note from a man I never knew till later on. Oliver Walker. <br />
      Simply put He had made a choice to rescue me from a sinking ship off the coast, brought me to safety, and nursed me back into the realm of the living. For months he took care of me in and out of consciousness.
      <br />
      When I woke He was gone on a supply run according to the note, I waited for a couple of weeks but He never returned and I couldn't stay any longer. I ventured out into an unknown Winter realm. Cold half-starved I
      found a small cabin and made a fire. That's another story. Oliver Walker and the Winter struggles. <br />
      I can't remember his name offhand...But I remember the name of the little outpost "The Silver Spoon". <br />
      The Silver Spoon was run by a funny quirky guy, he showed me how to set up a campfire and how to build basic fortifications. <br />
      I met Jeremy a loud annoying Aussie guy, but nonetheless, he seemed eager to teach. So I leanred everything I could. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at the Silver Spoon I met Theo, the leader of Duskar Before it became an actual town on a cliffside. At first, I refused the offer to join his camp as I was focused on gathering supplies to try and outgun
      the winter. <br /><br />

      Oliver showed up some weeks afterward and to my delight, He stayed and helped keep The Cabin safe. We grew closer during that winter. I found an old guitar and fixed her up. I started to collect old song books and
      played my guitar to whoever would lend an ear. <br />
      There was a town called Sunset run by a Lady...Iris, I believe her name was...thinking back...names seem too foggy to me now after everything is said and done. They were being attacked by a group of cannibals, wow.
      I say that now and it's just so normal, no one bats a lash at people eating their own kind these days, back then it was war. I killed my first person by pure accident and reflex, He was wearing a bear head mask,
      and I headshot him. I believe now perhaps that was when my Phobia of Bears happened. I hate bears. Story for another Day. The Sunset vs Cannibals Tale of two factions. <br />
      While working on my Cabin that I dubbed The Salty Cougar Tavern. I met my first friend, Anton. <br />
      Kind and helpful, we quickly became friends and I enjoyed knowing Oliver was in good hands with him. <br />
      Anton was a medic for a group called The Guardian Angels, run By Fenris and Shiva. I have many a memory to recount of The Guardian Angels, but I'll leave that for another story. <br />
      While struggling to survive the winter Oliver and I came across a group in Sandy Bay, The Red Union, run by Fernando and Cyrus. Odd bunch but at the time we offered assistance and made friends. It would only be
      further into the future that we would become enemies. The Salty Cougar, Against All Odds. <br />
      Time passed as did the cold bite of winter and the spring brought about change. Oliver chose to take a different path to pursue knowledge with Anton and The Red Union, I took Theo up on his offer to Join Duskar.
      Big storms had other plans though. <br />
      Gathering who remained after the big storms, Theo decided to move up to a place on a mountainside and there would lay down his roots. He hired Cerberus to act as security and protection against bandits and other
      threats. <br />
      I chose to stay down by the broken bridges and make a tavern. The Salty Cougar. I built day by day with Oliver's help and the support of many people. The Salty Cougar grew and people came to see her as a place to
      seek refuge, trade stories, and enjoy a good story or song around a campfire and always never charge for food, medical or basic help. <br />
      Many came by, we were neutral so we had every walk of life. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sanctuary Rangers to the Bandits of Ghosts. Heck, we even had an elusive group called The Collective stop by every now and again.<br />
      I didn't know much about anything back then, all I knew was how to roll a good doobie and play the guitar.<br />
      Oliver and Anton taught me how to shoot a shotgun. Things were simple back then. Easy and wholesome, I miss those days.<br />
      The Red Union fell to inner coup stuff, they tried to assassinate their leaders and all hell broke loose.<br />
      They rebranded and became The Red Militia.<br />
      The Reds would come by and torment The Tavern at all hours sending Cerberus down from the mountains to give us protection against them. Stress grew and things started to unravel. I met a Man named Warlock. It was
      during one of our chats that I was invited to go along on a day trip. I was high, so I don't remember even getting ready, I sort of just said ok, and tagged along. Up and up a mountain we went. All I had was my
      shotgun a can of peaches and a medical kit. Some prep I had.<br />
      We were attacked by bears and one of Warlock's Men was on the brink of death, Pheonix was his name.<br />
      Long story short and again The details for another story. I ended up with Warlocks Blood, without anyone even knowing.<br />
      We came to a bunker, a HUGE place. I loved it! Everyone seemed on edge, but not me...this place was sheer fun to me for some reason. Ever feel at home somewhere? The Bunker was that place for me. Oliver caught up
      but He had a completely opposite take on it, he felt the place was evil. It is a building, how can it be evil? Well, that's another story.<br />
      I tagged along with Lukas, an odd sort of a guy, who couldn't talk very well, but perhaps that's what made him seem endearing to everyone. I wanted to help him sort his scrambled mind. I guess that is how I ended
      up in the situation I currently find myself in. Queen of Mutants, a heck of a title I never wanted. But, It allowed me to experience a strong friendship bond and the pain that comes with losing that friendship.
      Another story for another time. Graylight and Skylar's Story.<br />
      The attacks on the Tavern intensified daily. The Red Militia was hellbent on crushing us because I had given shelter to The Collective. How was I supposed to know who they were, we run a tavern...not a detective
      agency.<br />
      The island pulled together and helped us often. We lost people along the way...friends whose faces I seem to be forgetting.<br />
      Anton started up The Arbiters with the help of Gaunt who I guess is by nature more a peacock than Anton so He was deemed the head face for them as Anton was more laid back and enjoyed just watching the chaos
      unfold. I designed The Arbiters Flag for them, and things were good. Life was good for a long while until they were not. People change. Greed sets in. Morals are lost to the winds of power and fortune, lost are the
      simplicities of friendship and loyalty. They turned into some sort of weird cult, I could never take them too seriously after that. Ghosts ended up leaving, I was sad to see Phantom and Beetlejuice leave. He gifted
      me a BBQ...wonder how many people were cooked on that thing.<br />
      Time goes on and I found myself on the brink of death, with no hope in sight and so addicted to morphine I couldn't tell my hand from and car tire. Bleeding out, alone, all hope lost, I laid there just waiting for
      death, then something sparked. I didn't want to die, I just didn't want to be alone. Oliver having left Me as he did, hit me hard.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I pulled the impossible, taking that bag of Warlocks blood and emptying it into my veins, hopped up on morphine, and slightly radiated due to running too close to the biozone in a feeble attempt to escape a hoard.
      I passed out.<br />
      Woke up to medical personnel and a doctor who, for the life of me shouldn't have been even allowed to have a crackerjack toy license, Micheal of the Pathfinders. Good lord, That guy attempted to steal blood from me
      twice while I was locked inside my own thoughts. I punched him out a few times and Mister Jamal from Cerberus, shot him in the foot and threw him over the cliff once. Pathfinders, that's the group...I got word to
      Dr. Verona an old coot who was into Virology, that the Doctor Micheal from his group had better stay the hell away or I'd kill him. We never heard from that doctor again till only recently. Bambi or Micheal, same
      guy. Stupid Son of a bitch, keeps on about having my blood. Bullshit whatever he stole from whatever hole in the ground wasn't mine. I hate needles so I would have known. He is a basket case in its own right, Story
      for another day. Bambi the Basket Case crackerjack Doctor. I'm getting better at story titles. I ended up inheriting Warlock's "Powers" so they call it, a mutation that allowed him to Control these huge beasts of
      war, Alpha mutants. Back then when the changes started I had no clue what was going on with me, My mind twisted with voices and thoughts, falling time and time again into that black pool that Warlock referred to as
      His Collective Hive Mind. Many months later, I have learned to control my thoughts and control the darkness that comes with that territory. I keep hidden to protect those few who still are worth saving, the small
      pockets of humanity still worth dying for, those who seek to make life better for everyone, and who make the world we now live in a little more tolerable.<br />
      What are that now 5 stories to write up? Perhaps that is my calling, simply writing the events and giving those stories to others so hopefully, they can learn from their mistakes. Gods know I have made so many in
      my time on Deer Isle.<br />
      This was only the first 8 months. The next 8 months will have to be another story. <br /><br />
