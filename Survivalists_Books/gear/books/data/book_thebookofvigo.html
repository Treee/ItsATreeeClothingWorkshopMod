      It came in a haze.<br />
      The vision, first.<br />
      The signs next.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before me lay the barren white — a snowfield whose expanse I could not fathom. The whipping snow spurred me into the depths of white, so far that returning was out of sight and mind. <br />
      The snowfield described a terrible Truth to me. The bitter cold and voracious land told a tale of creatures beyond comprehension, things with intentions and plans far beyond our own comprehension. They described to
      me their Intent, as well as their Purpose, and within me stoked the very fires of Initiative. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      She came to me in a veil of white. <br />
      Vigo, her name was. She told me through the whispers of the wind. And her vessel was so terrible to behold that I cowered before her figure. I expected death — it would have been the kind thing to do, to kill an
      old dog while he’s hurt — but instead I was given a burdensome warmth. <br />
      She bestowed her Word unto me, and then the words of her Father, Hemmel, the Icehammer, the Lord of Winter. Summer was a foreign dream, stricken from my childhood. I didn’t long for the school breaks anymore, the
      nostalgia of sitting in front of the television while my mother made dinner. I no longer relished games of hide and seek in the meadow, my friends and the fireflies all together. I didn’t miss the humidity nor the
      piquant heat of June days with no air conditioning. <br />
      I yearned for the frost.<br />
      Hemmel gave his word to me through Vigo. She haunts my dreams. <br />
      I lost my consciousness in that snowfield. I should have died, frostbitten and preserved in their holy ice, yet I remained unharmed. No frost burdened me, and when I awoke I could see the tender red of my fingers
      unharmed. My vitals hadn’t ceased. Oh! I had been chosen! Velin, Velin. The name taunted me through my return home. I could tell it was Velin’s blessing that spared me from a wintry death then. <br />
    </p>
    <p>The whispers described their manifesto. Frost would come through careful practice; a tantra I did not want to dishonor. <br /></p>
    <p>
      All good things came at a price of course.<br />
      Vigo’s lust was insatiable. Blood was her currency, and that of Hemmel’s too. When I left the snowfield, her vision persisted in my dreams and my waking moments. I could see her best when I stared off into space.
      She flickered between the lines — between understanding and lucidity. There was a hefty favor at play here.<br />
      I came to love the cold. Didn’t want to be away from what felt so good. <br />
      The dreams got worse too. There she was, Velin, Winterkiller, the worst of them all. So distant was the image of her Father that his might was a mystery. Velin showed herself in vicious detail. Sinewy arms were
      strung together by icy tendrils, and the formation composed a vile wing. She was long and too-tall, her features recessed into deep wells within her figure, skin warping around jagged bones. Velin. She draped that
      sinew wing around her shoulder as if it could clothe her, and when she spoke she borrowed a crude mimicry of English to describe her intent. Blood!<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to bring the Frost, I had to commit a cardinal sin. A murder that would bind us all to the same fate. It seems worth it to me — that one life should be traded for the good of all our kind. The frost, as I
      understand, is a unifying force — one that will level the playing field. There will no longer be a difference between my neighbors and I. The frost unifies all. <br />
      I was now a Prophet for their Vision, an uncanny guide for wills outside my good neighbor’s perception. It is my duty to bring this Truth forth to all, and by it, to practice the tantra Vigo, Velin, and the Father
      Hemmel have given to me. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The first act is to organize our brotherhood. Hemmel requires an army. Feeble ears do not listen to words spoken unless incentivised. <br />
      The second is to prepare for the onslaught of Winter. Goods, food, medicine, all should be shared within the brotherhood. Greed will alienate one brother from his next, and so when one is wealthy, all are wealthy.
      Our arms are our strongest defense against non-believers. Those who carry the negative vision of Winter must be taught, by word or by force. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The third is to hold close the image of Winter. Vanity of one’s self is destructive to our final goal. To give Winter home in your life, you must abandon Self. Your acts are for Winter. Your harvest is for Winter.
      Your wealth is for Winter. Identity distracts from the Truth, and one must experience Ego Death in order to see her Truth. <br />
    </p>
    <p>In giving up Self, you become a vessel for the Word. Prophecy cannot move through the body of the weak. Open yourself to the word of Winter and you will find absolution in the final season. <br /></p>
    <p>Living closer to these ideals will bring you clarity in vision. The vision of winter will make it’s blood-cost known, especially as we take these tenants closely and observe them with diligence.<br /></p>
