      Ahh The Bunker, a great labyrinth of a structure. Hopefully this book will help you navigate its halls and passages a little better, for there are hidden doors and crawlspaces littered throughout the entire
      facility. Rumor has it that there might even be an Alpha mutant or two left to guard the secrets of Warlock, but again, those are just rumors... Right?
    </p>
    <p>
      Step 1: Preparing for the Journey. <br />
      For starters, you're going to need a good amount of supplies to enter and exit the bunker. You'll need a full set of radiation gear (better known as a set of NBC), a gas mask with at least 4 full filters. Now, if
      you can't find any proper filters you can always make some. A respirator mask and a plastic bottle seem to make a sufficient replica, fill that with charcoal tablets and you're good to go. The tablets also can be
      used to refill the standard filters. A roll of duct tape to patch your NBC suit is good to have in case you take a scratch or bite from any of the local inhabitants. Next, you'll need at least 3 to 4 electrical
      kits to "hack" the gate controls, it takes awhile to hack it, so make sure you install a fresh filter before you start. A PO-X cure is good to have on you in case you make a mistake as well, I'm not entirely sure
      on what they do, but you'll feel better if you get a little radiation poisoning. Night vision is a must! It's really dark down there since the island lost power, so if you don't have any night vision you're going
      to have a bad time. Bring plenty of ammo and a gun you're comfortable shooting with, for on your way up there you may encounter a bear, military zeds or even something worse. Don't forget to bring food and lots of
      water, odds are you aren't going to find any on your first trip down there.

    <p>
      Step 2: Climbing the Mountain and Opening The Bunkers Blast Door. <br />
      If you're unfamiliar with the mountain, your best bet is to follow the road up there. One wrong step ascending the side and you might end up with a broken leg. As you ascend, stay alert to howls or growls, as a
      pack of wolves or a lone bear might be on their way for an easy snack. If you hear "screams" odds are they are coming from the "bio" wolves, which are a bit faster and harder to hit than the old regular wolf. As
      you get closer to the facility, I recommend stopping and putting your NBC suit and gas mask on, just in case there happens to be a large amount of wolves and mili zeds ahead. Don't waste time trying to kill the
      zeds as you head in, shoot them in the legs to cripple and move on. Move down to the "radiated forest" and you'll see a large, deep hole. Best to avoid that, I don't think you'll survive the fall. Keep moving till
      you find a structure and take the stairs down, at the bottom you'll see the Blast Door, the only thing between you and your goal. If you go to the opposite side of the room from the stairs you come down, there's a
      clean section of breathable air, this is a good spot to catch your breath, reload any mags and maybe get a quick bite to eat. Replace your filter with a clean one then get started on hacking the door. You might not
      get it on your first try, and if you don't you'll get shocked, a lot! I wouldn't recommend doing it more than twice before taking a break. You'll know you got it opened if you hear the siren going off "again" and
      the fact that you didn't get shocked. There are purple key cards still floating about the island but odds are you don't have one, those would get you in without having to worry about hacking it. After you hear the
      sirens you'll have to wait roughly 5 minutes. Once the gates are open, head on in... (Authors note: There are many paths in the bunker, most lead to the same location. I won't be going over every path, just the
      ones I personally take when leading expeditions and other less known paths.)

      Step 3: The Decent <br />
      As you enter make note of all the skeletons, people who got trapped inside. This should be a warning for you as well, as you'd only have 90 minutes before you join them, for that's when the door closes. Now there
      is another way out, but we'll get to that a little later. Go further in, eventually you'll come across 2 doors. Don't worry, they both lead to the same area. As you wander the halls, you'll come across cells and
      other rooms, storing ammo and gear from before the collapse of society. Make your way down until you get to 3 entrenches, 1 way is from the way you came, 1 also leads back to those same hallways and a stairway
      down. This landing is a safe place to remove your NBC gear and where you'll want to put it all back on. If you look closely to the right of the stairway down you'll see some vines on the wall, you can jump through
      here to get to the escape exit. (Skip to Step 4: The Escape Route.) Make your way down the stairs to the next landing, from here enter the hallway, you'll see a big radio transmitter and stairs down. There is also
      a subway access straight ahead that leads to similar locations. For now, head down the radio transmitters stairs, careful not to fall. At the bottom you'll enter a large room, I like to think of this area as the
      main area because it has multiple paths that take you to different locations. Explore, loot and keep your eyes open for zeds. Head down until you reach a Pepsi machine, hop over it and you'll be able to crawl
      through an opening that leads to a long stairway down. This leads to a dangerous way down, not worth it so just go back to the Pepsi machine. Head back up two landings from here and you'll see a half closed blast
      door, crawling through it will lead you to the long way down. Carefully make your way down while hugging the wall, there will be the occasional pipe blocking your path you'll either have to crawl under or jump
      over. After what feels like ages you'll reach the bottom, from here it's a bit of a maze, navigate it until you reach a long ladder going even further down. Climb down, occasionally getting off to loot the area,
      your main goal is to get to the bottom. Once there, at the far left of the cave with around 8 military bunkhouses, there is a wooden rickety staircase going down. Go down, navigate through the rocks and you'll
      reach a stream, a good place to fill your canteens if you've run out of water. Follow it and you'll come across a helicopter pad, this is the bottom of the giant hole from earlier, a good spot to get a little much
      needed sunlight and make yourself a fire with some of the sticks laying about. If you've gotten this far in less than 45 minutes, you can make your way back up by retracing your steps. Note that when you go back up
      the long ladder, take it slow, it's a bit slippery at the top. I've seen a few people fall to their demise there. Now if for some reason you didn't make it back out in time, here's what you need to do...

      Step 4: The Escape Route <br />
      1. Through tunnel entrance <br />
      2. Stay straight down stairs <br />
      3. Turn left <br />
      4. Turn right <br />
      5. Go up the short ladder <br />
      6. Follow the tunnel to the next door on the right <br />
      7. Go up 3 long stair cases <br />
      8. Don't turn, stay straight as the tunnel turns <br />
      9. Take the last left <br />
      10. It's a straight shot from here, follow the tunnel until you reach a dead end with some vines. Crawl through the vines and you're back at the Blast door you hacked to get in. <br />

      That's about it, I hope this helps you in any future adventures! <br /><br />
