    <title>Compendium Of Artefacts</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      This is a collection of fact and perspective on the famed artefacts, or as they are more commonly known, “obelisks”. It is likely that they earned this name in thanks to their shape, as they most commonly manifest
      as large, stone pillars; however, this compendium covers not only these pillars, but also, other artefacts related to this vein of mystery. I write to you as Gaius Rusticus of the Sanctum and hope this book serves
      as interest to both novice and scholar of such international mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cambridge dictionary describes an artefact as “an object that has been made by a person, such as a tool or decoration, especially one that is of historical interest”. Although the term “artefact” is not unique
      to the subject matter, it is very closely associated with it because of worldwide interest. But what exactly are these artefacts?
    </p>
    <p>
      The first artefact was discovered in the Gambia region of Africa in the 1830s by the British, during their colonisation, explorers Lord Walther M. Pitsby and his wife, Lady Miranda W. Pitsby. The artefact was
      described as ‘abnormally tall, with a glowing foreign insignia carved into the stone surface’. The couple oversaw the construction of a settlement in the region which required excavation, leading to the discovery
      of the artefact which closely resembled an ‘obelisk’. At the time, the British Empire were displeased with their apparent rogue nature because the prospect of a settlement was of higher importance than a simple
      dig, leading to a complete retraction of funding. The duo proceeded to finance an archaeological dig out of their own pocket but ultimately ran out of money to purchase the necessary equipment to dig deeper.
      Determined not to return to Britain a failure, Lord Pitsby contacted any firm that would listen (which was not many) in hopes they would finance the operation. A few days later, modern equipment capable of seeing
      the dig to completion arrived in Gambia, with the mark of ‘Lock Fine Arms Limited’ on each crate. Of course, this company would grow over the next 170 years and become known as Lock and Sons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, not much is known about the artefact discovered in the Gambia region for several reasons. For one, global communication was in a primitive state. But perhaps more important is the fact that the
      British Empire suppressed information about what occurred in Gambia for many years after it occurred. However, what we do know is that Lord and Lady Pitsby lacked any significant involvement in the project after
      the Empire began overseeing operations – they faded away into the background after enjoying substantial fame in Europe and were rumoured to remain locked to the large allocations of land afforded to them by the
      crown. On a darker note, there is some evidence to suggest that this is not the case, and that instead of voluntarily seceding to the crown, Lord and Lady Pitsby returned to Gambia and engaged in a gory ritual,
      resulting in the latter’s beheading and the former’s sudden disappearance – as if he had vanished into thin air.
    </p>
    <p>
      By World War 2, the Gambian discovery had been overshadowed by a plethora of other discoveries of a similar nature. During the Tehran Conference of 1943, a reporter asked Soviet Premier, Joseph Stalin, whether he
      was devoting resources into studying these artefacts (by now, they had become known as Obelisks, as we learn from countless documents found in the Biblioteca Angelica library in Rome) and if the USSR had
      ascertained their significance. Stalin’s reply was certain, as he claimed that the USSR is ‘extremely knowledgeable in all topics of historical significance’. Unfortunately, we do not have any Russian texts to
      provide support to this claim, other than the usual news report that followed shortly after obelisks were found.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most obelisks are described as being unusually tall and made of stone, with a luminescent sigil in their surface. There does not seem to be much difference other than shape in most cases, however, it seems that
      cyan sigils are more common in the western world whilst orange sigils are found often in the eastern regions. The state of Maine and countries Denmark, Iceland, Greenland, Germany and Isle of Man are the only
      western territories to be host to an obelisk with an orange sigil. The Iron Curtain prevents us from knowing if this is the inverse in eastern territories.
    </p>
    <p>What is significant about the artefacts / obelisks?</p>
    <p>
      The obelisks hold a similar level of intrigue as sites like the Great Pyramid of Giza, Stonehenge and Petra. This is because even before the Fall, we could not understand what was causing the obelisks to glow, nor
      were we able to understand what the insignias in the surfaces meant. It remains a mystery as to why many obelisks are found in near impossible locations, like the top of a steep mountain; regions which seem
      ludicrous for human travel. Despite these abnormalities, perhaps the most confusing aspect of the obelisks is their apparent ability to change the atmosphere around them. Nearly everybody that has stood near an
      obelisk reports feeling intense heat, to the point where they cannot linger any further. This is even made apparent by several people experiencing low-level burns to the skin upon direct contact in specific
      conditions. Many people report strange incidences, such as: rumbling from beneath the ground, strange coloured gas seeping from the obelisk, chanting and humming in the distance, ethereal-looking animals crawling
      out of the ground, falling unconscious, robed figures attacking them and more when in the presence of an obelisk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another reason the artefacts hold significance is a large collective of folk known as the ‘Pilgrims’ guard them. The Pilgrims are a very secluded people, who seem to reject the use of advanced technology. They have
      unanimously been found wearing ancient-looking robes of an earthy texture, with crossbows and spears to match. Upon conversation with one Pilgrim, who referred to their status within their collective as a
      ‘Guardian’, they stated that their purpose was to protect and observe the obelisks. They strictly remain outside of island activities, but this has not left them weak, as made apparent by their attacks on the three
      companies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pilgrims are responsible for wiping out a ship of both STAG and Lock and Sons personnel, found off the coast west of Old Town. Their reasoning was that the companies were attempting to steal an obelisk, which
      they refer to as the ‘Sphere’, and would not return it. We will delve more into the Sphere later. An entire ship of armed company guards was wiped out by the Pilgrims, using crossbows and spears. Their work is
      still available for viewing, which was their intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did the same to an ESPEN ship, found off the coast of an island very far north, to the east of Portland. At the time of writing, it is unknown why they did this, however a very large, extravagant spear was
      found onboard. Perhaps this was an artefact of theirs?
    </p>
    <p>
      I cannot write much about the Pilgrims due to a lack of simple knowledge. It is speculated that they are a shadow of a former organisation created to maintain a balance of anomalous activity – one that was
      prominent in Ancient Egypt, based on their robe and patterns, but eventually withered over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far, we have covered what the artefacts are, why they are significant and what they have been known to do. Now, we will delve into the obelisks that we know of. Each obelisk differs in the sense that they each
      serve a different purpose. For example, one seems to be responsible for providing heat to the others. We know this because when one obelisk was disturbed, the others would cease exhibiting a certain effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Artefact of Judgement <br />
      This obelisk earned its name purely through cultural rituals. The Pilgrims constructed a village close to the site which served as a position to mark initiates as full members. They have not yet shared the
      activities that take place in this ritual, but it serves as a judging ground for their people. This artefact is responsible for causing severe burns to anybody that does not seem to pass the Pilgrim’s trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Artefact of Gaia <br />
      This obelisk exists in the centre of nature upon the isle. It is surrounded by dense woodland, as well as streams, grass, rocks and bush. Subsequently, it was named after the Greek Goddess of Earth, Gaia, due to
      being in the very middle of nature. Some speculate that the artefact is responsible for the surrounding green, as the area further away from the site is less stimulated with vegetation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Artefact of Subjugation <br />
      This obelisk is home to a mass of dead corpses, all of which belonged to various employees of the three large corporations. Conversation with the Pilgrims revealed that the artefact responds with hostility towards
      any that would misuse it maliciously, or those who would ‘subjugate’ it. It is one of the most far-removed from the isle, sitting in the far eastern side of Deer Isle’s waters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Artefact of Calefaction <br />
      This obelisk is perhaps the most significant, as it appears to be a source of geothermal energy. Somehow, it redirects heat present deep beneath the surface towards the other obelisks, allowing them to secrete it.
      This artefact is very easily found in the northern mountains as a smoke plume pours from it day and night. There are many bodies surrounding it – all of which have been horribly burnt to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Artefact of Endurance <br />
      This obelisk is one of the most unknown. It is hidden somewhere on the arctic island. Due to being in such an inhospitable environment, it was named ‘endurance’ due to requiring strong physical and mental fortitude
      to reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conclusion <br />
      The Obelisks are naturally strange. Nobody knows why they glow or why they are in such strange locations. It is not understood why such a humongous tribe of people guard them and claim to speak with a higher deity
      through them. Some believe that they are magic artefacts, remnants from an age long forgotten. Others agree in the fact that they are ancient, but they are not magic – merely a product of a science not yet fully
      explored. It is true that some of the things they have produced seem unearthly: spectral hounds, rumbling, rendering people unconscious and more seems to suggest that they have some level of sentience. I believe
      that we were a civilisation that did not explore even 30% of the ocean before the Fall and given the oceans are vast, there is undoubtedly a lot that we do not know of. Some of it could be perceived as ‘magic’, but
      the fact that each company is willing to fund entire ships and crews into extracting these artefacts (with only ESPEN apparently managing to succeed) suggests that they are significant. So many have said that these
      obelisks have altered them, perhaps it is true.

      This compendium was written between May-July 2007 and considers information from the 19th to 21st century, based off of documents scavenged, interested parties consulted and direct contact with the Artefact of
      Judgement and Calefaction.
