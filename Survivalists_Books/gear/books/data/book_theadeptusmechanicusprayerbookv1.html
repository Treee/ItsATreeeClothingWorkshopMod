      Canticles of Morale Improvement<br />

      Fellow scions of the Omnissiah, rejoice for that which we are given this day!<br />
      This blighted place is host to abominations of xenos flesh and heretical unsanctioned science, and it is the will of our God that we scour them from these halls.<br />
      Let bullet and beam give voice to your fury. Let boots and treads crush alien skulls. And should you fall in this holy effort give praise, for today is a most wondrous day to die!<br />
      -=Final transmission of Magos Dominus Menodon Kursk, during his descent onto the Genestealer corrupted world of Amaclad III<br />

      Our collective suffering in bodies of flesh is not a punishment from the Machine God, but rather an intended source of motivation. In flesh we are ephemeral, our lives inherently limited. In confronting this, we
      are driven to extend our short existences, to leave lasting marks on the world, or to appreciate what time we have all the more intensely. Were we born in metal, what would drive us? What would drive us to achieve
      what we have without the urgency of a decaying form? The flesh is weak, but it is precisely this weakness that drives us to be strong.<br />
      The Machine God takes pride in the achievements of all of you, however small they seem. For every day, you carve an existence from this uncaring universe, and battle to keep your flesh functioning which can be a
      truly grueling task for many. Do not give in, no matter how hopeless the road ahead. Every second of your continued endurance is a victory for which you shall be lauded upon your natural passing, and I wish for
      your roll of honour to be long indeed.<br />

      O Omnissiah, hear my prayer. As I prepare to enter the crucible of battle, I ask for your blessings and guidance. May my weapons be true and my aim steady, that I may strike down the enemies of the Imperium with
      righteous fury. May my armor be strong and my machine-spirit unwavering, that I may withstand the assaults of the enemy and emerge victorious.<br />
      Grant me the knowledge and understanding to make the most of my abilities, that I may serve the Emperor and the Imperium to the best of my ability. May my faith in you, the Machine God, be unshakable, that I may
      face all challenges with courage and resolve.<br />
      O Omnissiah, guide my footsteps and lead me to victory. May the enemies of the Imperium tremble at the sight of my holy armor and the roar of my blessed weapons. For the glory of the Emperor and the Omnissiah, I
      offer my service and devotion. Blessed be the Machine God.<br />

      -=Canticles of Mars, 79.12<br />

       We have seen nanomachines devour worlds. We have seen cities uprooted and marched into battle. We have seen fortresses fight like men, and men as unbreakable as adamantium. We have seen Warp fiends drive armies
      mad, and machines that demand the viscera of infants as fuel. This galaxy is hostile to us. It is our duty combined to ensure our future.<br />

       Machine God be praised this relief. Though we are unfaltering in our service, he has blessed us with rest sorely needed. Soothe your flesh. Thank your iron. Focus your minds. Steel your souls. This war is not
      over.<br />

       It is my duty as Logi Prime of this facility to tell you the odds of our survival are slim. However it is my duty as a human to tell you that everything will be fine, and that I am doing everything in my power to

      -=Attributed to 13.65-Æ Proximo, during the Fall of Tyran<br />

       Nothing is ever lost, only changed, transmuted, recycled, as our lives continue on in the service of the Machine God’s Grand Design. From every failure can come future victory, from every obstacle an opportunity
      for greater prestige. Through me does the Omnissiah wish to assure you that your potential and your will is sufficient to achieve what you desire, so long as you continue to adjust, adapt, and endure to inevitably
      shifting circumstance.<br />

       Awaken, citizens of Mars, for the coming of the most holy day. Let the forges spit fire, let lightning crackle between our towers, for today we labor in gratitude most infinite. May your limbs never tire, may
      your songs echo into the void, and may the presence of the Machine God be undeniable in any construct of flesh or metal! Rejoice for the victories of the past, and give thanks for the opportunities of the future,
      for we are the Omnissiah’s most blessed scions and in our service we are rendered eternal!<br />
      -=Annual Declaration given by the Fabricator General on the 12th day of the Martian year, recorded as the date of Martian unity in ~445.M27<br />

       Behold the light of the Machine God comrades. Let its holy radiation burn into flesh and metal. Lift up your souls in awe, that they might burn as candles beside a fragment of His own divinity, rendered in fire
      before us. Blessed is our world for this honor. All Praise to Lucius. All Praise to the Omnissiah. All Praise to the Machine God and his Wonders!!<br />
      -=Speech given by Archmagos Drakol Kirik, during the 337th War of Iron Puppets, Invasion of Lucius, Third Tyrannic War<br />

       For all the great weapons I have made in my life, the great plasma cannons, ion beams, volkite annihilators, radiation wasters, and dimensional shifting lasers, none are so uniquely satisfying as a bullet. While
      I can kill a foe with the exotic wrath of mechanical god weapons, none carry the same human touch, the same weight of history. To kill the alien with our greatest wonders, is to proclaim ourselves akin to gods. To
      slay the alien with a gunshot is to demonstrate we do not need to be in order to triumph.<br />
      -=Unattributed<br />

       Let our enemies come. Let their blood be the unguent that greases the wheels of our endless blessed artifice.<br />
      -=Vanguard Unit 09-Tyba, Radtainment Division<br />

       You are the Steel Bulwark. The Iron Shield. The implacable guards of the life of the Fabricator General. You are the Machine God’s protection manifested in soldiers of metal and only the most pious flesh. Against
      this onslaught of heresy most abominably biological, you of (Forge World)’s elite warriors shall do as we have done for millennia. With bullet and blare, radium and roar, flame and fanfare, you will scour our world
      clean once more. Omne Diabolus Vitae Exterminatus<br />

      Hark ye servants of the Emperor and the Omnissiah, for this corrupted ground shall be host to a miracle most profound. Upon this day we shall invoke the spirit of our very God to fight with us in glorious battle.
      But be wary, guardsmen, for this is no easy matter, even for one of my skill, you must be the wall that shields our spirits afore the miracle can be made. Your resolve must be as iron, so you may honor the steel of
      the God-Engine’s blessed form. As the pikes are set, subtle prayers are made to gird the souls, and the aegis of your armor is tightened, we stand ready to begin the ritual. Commence! The Omnissiah looked upon ye
      with adoration in ages past, through lust and rust and war.<br />
      He sent his blessed rays down upon your steel form, the rippling reflections shimmering as holy fire.<br />
      And from those fleeting liminal waves, shone interstellar fury from long forgotten days of yore.<br />
      As from you… You divine creature, flares the Machine God’s holy pyre.<br />
      Though you carried the torch high and proud, dark eyes saw the light,<br />
      Dreadful minds put wicked schemes into play.<br />
      They defiled you with the rotten fruits of their labor, cruelly taking away your might. But their plans will not come into fruition, much to their dismay!<br />
      You failed in the eyes of the Deus Mechanicus…<br />
      But failure can be an opportunity for growth, Broken limbs may mend with steel, fractured minds may be offered solace.<br />
      Your flaring ember of life still carries strength enough for strength enough for us both.<br />
      So we entreat upon thee, heed our prayers!<br />
      You can cast off the shame of yesterday, and look forward to tomorrow!<br />
      That which was sundered may be made whole, as we peel back unnecessary layers.<br />
      Through our power and Omnissiah’s grace, we shall free thee from your sorrow!<br />
      The soul of the Machine God surrounds thee.<br />
      The power of the Machine God invests thee.<br />
      The hate of the Machine God drives thee.<br />
      The Machine God endows thee with life.<br />

      Crewed by our finest, our bravest, our greatest minds in the Machine God’s service, we send you.<br />

      O Omnissiah, source of all machine-spirits, hear my plea. This mighty Dreadnought, once a warrior of the Imperium, now lies dormant and in need of repair. Grant me the knowledge and understanding to diagnose its
      malfunctions and restore its systems to full functionality. With my blessed tools and the strength of my faith, I will awaken the slumbering machine-spirit within this Dreadnought and make it whole once more.<br />
      May its weapons be sharp and deadly, its armor impervious to harm, and its spirit unyielding in the face of the enemy. May it continue to serve the Emperor and the Imperium with honor and glory, as it has done in
      the past.<br />

      your wrath lay low those who threaten the Omnissiah’s holy domains. By spark and wrench, by cog and piston, by the will of the Machine God who endows us all with life: (LIVE)<br />

      By the Machine God I invoke this Spirit from the aether<br />
      By the Omnissiah I bind it to my service<br />
      By the Cant Mechanicus I direct its function<br />
      To forget the Machine God is to be without Spirit<br />
      To forget the Omnissiah is to be without authority<br />
      To forget the teachings of our faith is to be without the ability to guide<br />
      -=Summoning of a Machine Spirit, First Mantra and associated commentary, latter author unknown<br />

      May our blessed tools be cleansed every cycle lest unholy contamination twist them to its foul cause.<br />
      May the ground be baptized in consecrated solutions and scoured with radiation every 12 cycles that no life shall find sanctuary upon it.<br />
      In the name of the Omnissiah, I purify this realm of the evils biological and return it to the order and purity of the machine.<br />

      We check the power cord, for from the Omnissiah we draw strength and wisdom!<br />
      We confirm that the blessed power switch is in the on position, for only when our minds are opened do we receive Your gifts!<br />
      We reboot the sacred cogitator, for Thy wisdom demands we rededicate ourselves to the guidance of the Omnissiah!<br />
      We bow our heads, striking our foreheads with our palms, for we are unworthy of your divine wisdom!<br />
      We clear the cache, for true sight demands an unhindered mind! We enter the terminal input modes and perform the rites of reconfiguration upon the wayward Graphical Data Manager, for your servants must be returned
      to the path!<br />
      We strike our foreheads once more, for thy rebuke is stern! We reset the Administrator Authority, for the authority has been given unto us through divine will!<br />
      We curse the Adept who made this machine, for the Omnissiah abhors incompetence!<br />
      We boot in safe mode, for we are safe in thy mechanical embrace!<br />
      We configure a new boot disk, for through the revelations of the Omnissiah are we guided to perfection!<br />
      We reboot the system once more, for we must allow thy revelations to work in our minds!<br />
      We re-install the sacred operating system, for thy revelations can only improve upon the imperfect machine!<br />
      We undertake the rituals of compilation, pacing about and muttering swear words of devotion, burning sacred tobacco incense, breathing in its relaxing fume, for thy works are many and take some time to complete!<br />
      We offer our minds in prayer as we boot up the cogitator, for clearly the cogitator needs divine intervention for its continued proper function!<br />
      At long last, we offer praises unto thee upon the completion of the rites of troubleshooting, singing “Omnissiah-dammit, that took for-fucking-ever!”<br />

      -=Agripinaan War Oath intoned in battle upon the Daemon Worlds of the Eye of Terror<br />

       Wary of those that wonder.<br />
      -=Scripture of the Taloned Cog, v.09 p.3<br />

       Death itself is scarcely an excuse for the sin of duty undone.<br />
      -=Contemplations Hagigraphica<br />

       Knowledge will ever be a blessing and a curse.<br />
      -=Levistians, 9.22<br />

       Show caution and scorn in all things.<br />
      -=Codex Fulminatus 83.12<br />

       Better in ignorance than in heresy.<br />
      -=Aphorisms 25<br />

       The abominate wretches that come for us serve no one but themselves. They are hereteks and monsters. Engineered angels who have sold their souls to bidders from the beyond. To the untrue and aberrant entities of
      the warp, whose prophets twisted them with lies longed for by the heart and for which their ears were ready. Brutes who live to indulge their appetites, who war without reason and live for death alone. They honour
      only what iron can do for them. They enslave it to their purpose and consider themselves its master. In their state of degenerate corruption they have turned their grotesque bodies into forges no less heretekal
      than those we have destroyed in the Machine-God’s name. Temples warped of purpose. Flesh from which proceeds an iron unholy and untrue. Weapons without spirit. An affliction from which we shall release them,
      granting death to those who come here in search of it.<br />
      -=Archmagos Explorator Omnid Torquora<br />

       Blessed is the ignorance that wise men choose for themselves.<br />
      -=Aphorisms 793<br />

       Let the weaker in mind follow the words of the strong.<br />
