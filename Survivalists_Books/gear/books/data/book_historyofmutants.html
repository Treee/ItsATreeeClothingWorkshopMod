    <p>
      The world we live in today is home to things that were once unique to movie theaters, literature and the ravings of madmen. Time and time again, <br />
      humanity has proven that we are capable of doing near magical things with technology; our feet have touched the surface of the moon, our telescopes <br />
      have seen billions of years into the past, diseases that have wiped out entire civilisations have been cured by a concoction in a syringe and so much more. <br />
      With the possibility of tremendous good, the sludge of evil sloshes behind it in equivalent power.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Deer Isle - a place that many of us believed to be a safe haven away from the walking dead was proven to be just as tainted with sociopathic heathens and corpses. <br />
      God have mercy on the newcomers who wash up on these shores, because the denizens of Deer Isle most definitely will not. <br />
      All this leads us to the topic that is of utmost importance, the topic that this isle will be remembered for: a pinnacle in scientific discovery, <br />
      the story of a most controversial man who created the Mutant. Warlock. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A book of his deeds can be found around these parts, so we will not focus on him. Pick up any radio and ask who he was, and trust me when I <br />
      write that you will ignite the rampant excitement of all who relinquish moral conviction and their own personalities to try scrape so much as <br />
      a sliver of his achievements. No. This book is to document my story of the Black Palm.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to remember them as the first organised family of Mutants, and they are a family. To those who do not understand what a Mutant is, <br />
      I will provide simple description and follow it up with a more detailed analysis. <br />
      The Mutant is a human who was injected with the Mutant Serum, which was created by the aforementioned Warlock. <br />
      When he created this serum, he did so without implementing a fail-safe which meant that anyone could go around and stick <br />
      a needle into your neck, putting you on the path of the Mutant. Thankfully, the Black Palm adjusted his work leading us to now have a serum that may only be taken by own free will.<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      The Mutant is almost fully biologically dead, from what I know. They progress in stages, with each stage granting new abilities and new curses. <br />
      Upon injecting the serum, there is a chance of immediate death, agony, blood clotting, fainting, nausea, radiation poisoning, organ failure, <br />
      withering of the limbs and more ailments. Some serums can be manufactured to progress MUCH quicker, but come with a higher chance of fatality. <br />
      Those who survive this trial are welcomed into what we call Stage One.<br /><br />

      Stage One. Skin begins to peel from your body. Flies begin to harass you and feast on your weeping flesh. <br />
      You become weak, tired and unable to stomach much food. Similar to the effects of severe dehydration paired with several nights of inadequate sleep.<br />
      This does not last long - for me, it lasted eight hours. Fortunately, the serum I was forced to take progressed significantly faster than any other I have seen to date.<br /><br />

      Stage Two. Where skin once was, calloused green 'hide' replaces. Your pupils are nearly inseparable from the where the white was, and are dark grey.<br />
      Your nose withers and falls, as do all reproductive organs. What cells remain are incredibly irradiated, meaning you can no longer stomach human food <br />
      and can relish in the radiation, which sustains you far greater than any food imaginable. <br />
      There is no visible physical change to your apperance from Stage Two to Stage Three. During this period, your eyes will adapt <br />
      to see near perfectly in the night sky with the downside of needing shaded glasses during the day. The undead will no longer attack you, <br />
      nor will the hatchlings from the radiation. <br />
      The hatchlings are called head-spiders, which look like human heads morphed onto a pair of spider's legs. <br />
      They run up to humans and burst, leaving some meat and their legs for Mutant consumption. <br />
      They can be harvested using a sharp knife on the pod if you approach unheard and used as near harmless grenades, though they do cause humans to faint on common occasion. <br /><br />

      Stage Four. The final physical change, where the Mutant loses their ears and adopts more skeletal features in the face and body. <br />
      Skin becomes dark yellow at the hands. When the moon takes over the sky, they can sustain a fall from any height without pain. <br />
      They are untouched by the undead, nurtured by radiation and completely unrecognisable. Many Mutants do not notice that they are <br />
      slightly more resilient against temperatures as well as all illness. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The chain of the Mutant is now complete. <br />
      This is the oldest knowledge passed down to me by the first Mutant Gift Giver, Pnut of the Black Palm. <br />
      Pnut was one of the wisest Americans I have ever met. He was one of the first to take the Serum and the Leader of the Black Palm,<br />
      which was a faction of Mutants that resided in the Powerplant and nurtured the *Flowers around the isle. <br />
      The Black Palm was the first organised family that embodied the true image of the Mutant - capable of tremendous evil, capable of tremendous good - just as the unmutated are. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember when I first met Pnut. He came to my shop to buy some clothes for him and his brother, specifically some robes. <br />
      This was before I was injected with the Serum, and I hadn't met a Mutant before. When he revealed his face I was perturbed, which I now say as a Mutant is completely natural. <br />
      He explained to me that he took what he referred to as the 'Gift' and so did his brother. He was at this point a Stage Three Mutant, and as I bid <br />
      them farewell from the shop, his brother passed out due to being on the verge of entering Stage Four. We had to hurry to the Powerplant where he would be stronger. <br />

      Whilst his brother grew accustomed to his new abilities, Pnut and I played games of chess and blackjack long into the night. <br />
      I was fascinated by the person that sat in front of me as he spoke about plans to create a haven for all of his kind within the Powerplant. <br />
      Fast forward a few weeks. During the early days, Pnut had to receive more Mutant Serums from the Observer, who is currently on the mainland with the rest of the Alpha Mutants. <br />
      The second time he came to my shop, he brought about 10 new Mutants who all had glowing red eyes. As you know, <br />
      it is common to hear people speak of their plans and nothing come to fruition, so when I saw that Pnut had accomplished the <br />
      task of recruiting 10 trustworthy friends, I knew that he wasn't like the rest. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot continue the story without me referencing how I came to be a Mutant. As we have previously mentioned, <br />
      the first batch of Serums could easily be forced into somebody without their consent. I was one of the few who suffered this fate. <br />
      After I was injected and suffered through the first stage, Pnut welcomed me with open arms. He understood I did not want this 'Gift' <br />
      and yet he treated me as kin. I was invited into the Powerplant and he showed me what his family was building - a district for people who practiced crafts, <br />
      warehouses filled with nails and building supplies, comfortable housing for those on the Mutant path. The level of trust within the invisible walls of the <br />
      radiation was unparamount to anything I've seen before - you could leave your door open and not have to worry about anybody taking anything. If we needed something, <br />
      the Palm was there to provide or show you the way. We were all bound by oath to never harm one another, and though you can argue that the <br />
      threat of death is like the sword of Damocles, it worked, because it wasn't the main incentive. <br />
      Their oath was the only oath I have ever known to be upheld. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      This was of course temporary. Soon, the unmutated learned how to prolong the lifespan of gas mask filters and reinforce <br />
      suits that permit access to the radiation. The rose glasses had to be placed on the table for now, as this chapter brings <br />
      us to the events of when a rogue faction got their hands on Serums. The Black Palm had welcomed new families called <br />
      The Raven Syndicate, Visionaries and Harvesters into the fold. All of us were bound by blood, so despite me disagreeing with <br />
      some of their goals, we were brothers and sisters. The Ravens were the muscle of the family, the Palm were the brains and the Harvesters? <br />
      I didn't get to know them too well, but they were a mix of both from what I can tell. <br />
      I write this because it is important that we cement the fact that Mutants are incredibly capable of evil. <br />
      Time and time again, I hear on the radio about how "every Mutant I've met has been kind" as if to elude that all Mutants are. <br />
      In clinical psychology, we refer to it as the 'positive halo effect' which is where we observe one thing which is appealing to us <br />
      about somebody and apply it to other aspects. For example, I see that you are attractive which is good so I assume that other things about you are good. <br />
      This, combined with stereotyping, causes many issues in the Mutant slash Unmutated world.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      This analysis explains a faction called The Meeting Place, who I remember originated as very kind folk in Warren Cove. <br />
      During my time within the Black Palm 'empire' we'll call it, this belief was incorrect. <br />
      Led by Brother Donovan, The Meeting Place became a faction of hate for Mutants. Donovan was a priest regimented in his belief that Mutants were the spawn of the devil. <br />
      He branded some of my kind with burning flame, dissected them, inflicting incredible amounts of agony all because of hate. <br />
      I remember working in the shop when a courier from the Palm came to talk to me about one of these events, and I rushed over as soon as I knew. <br />
      By then, the Mutants had arranged what we called the 'Brotherhood', a militia of those of us who would fight when the time comes to protect our kind, <br />
      as well as some other folk. Our identifier was a strip of *biomass wrapped around our arms, which bolstered our abilities and allowed us to stay <br />
      outside of the radiation for longer periods of time without needing to feed. I was a member of the Brotherhood, but did not get to attend this mission. <br />
      After discussing what Donovan had done, the Brotherhood rushed to Prospect Shores, though it was mainly the Raven Syndicate, where Donovan had been spotted. <br />
      Prospect Shores was a popular settlement a while ago, though it is abandoned now. I remember something to do with returning a flag, which is how they <br />
      knew that Donovan was there and I remember a humongous party as the Brotherhood carried Donovan's body home to feed the flower.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Long before this, the Black Palm had learned how to make their own version of the Serum, as well as accelerants. <br />
      Keep in mind that nearly every day, a new person was being welcomed into the family under oath. For a long time, <br />
      the Palm were the gatekeepers of the Mutant Serum which meant that they could wield large control over who entered the radiation. <br />
      They were one of the largest powers on the Island. At long last, we have arrived to the conflict between them and the Arbitration. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The Arbitration were one of the most profound denouncers of Warlock. The Arbitration have been a faction for a long time now and believe in 'balance' on the island. <br />
      They do this through causing chaos where they feel it is necessary and enforcing peace in areas of chaos, They have been known to rob, torture, eat and raid people <br />
      to maintain control, as well as defend small groups, loners, traders, medics, towns from things that would do them harm. <br />
      I remember the radio being filled with accusations from the Arbitration towards the Palm, stating that one of their members had been robbed.<br />
      The Palm continually stated that they didn't do it but there was no real communication, just argument. I was approached to see if I could learn <br />
      more about a suspected murder committed by the Palm, but I was unable to find anything incriminating. This set the scene for disaster - the Arbitration <br />
      marched down to the gazebo where the Palm held meetings and though I don't know what happened there, I know that they left <br />
      shooting loud guns into the air and shouting on the radio once more. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      I write of these incidences to inform you of the adversity that the Black Palm faced, and I don't do it justice because I do not write nor know every little detail. <br />
      In their peak, the Mutant family of the Powerplant, which was commonly referred to as the 'Zone', reached numbers of around 50 to 65. <br />
      These Mutants accomplished the feat of discovering how to create the purest of drugs, both for recreational and medical use. How to forge swords and golden sheets,<br />
      how to create the most advanced Serum in scientific history and even improve upon it. Mutants felt safe when the Black Palm was around. <br /><br />

      You have now read my account of events, which I believe embody the character of the Black Palm, detail parts of the Mutant and more. <br />
      It is my hope that these pages can be used to create informed opinions on the delicate subject pertaining to Mutants and progress further than the debased, <br />
      the ignorant and the uneducated. I have only wrote what I know to be fact and outlined what I am unsure of. I was not a member of the Black Palm <br />
      or any of the aforementioned factions. May these words be used to your advantage. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Notes:<br />
      *Flower - a seed that springs up from the earth, fed by radiation and flesh. Grows slowly until it ruptures into an enormous red flower that engulfs the surrounding areas in radiation. <br />
      *Observer - an agent of Warlock who provided guidance to the Mutants. As of writing this in the summer of 2006, the Observer has been fighting on the Mainland alongside Alpha Mutants.<br />
      *Alpha Mutant - a tall, extremely powerful creation of Warlock. Many did his bidding, though the few remaining are only aggressive when provoked. Warlock no longer has control over these beings.<br />
      *Biomass - a mound of flesh that can be found in radioactive areas as well as around the isle. I am unsure of how this came to be - when shot,<br />
      it spurts blood and shares texture to a sponge. Shooting it can result in explosions of blood and your bullets ricocheting.<br />
