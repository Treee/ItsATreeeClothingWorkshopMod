    <title>A Guide To Blacksmithing</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <br />
    <p>A Brief History</p>
    <p>
      Blacksmithing has been a key profession in both ancient and modern societies all over the world. It was more prominent in ancient societies for weapon and tool making and was a more crude variation, much like the
      ways apocalyptic blacksmiths use now. In Modern society, it is more industrialized. Larger quantities of metals were smelted down and formed by heavy machinery to make building materials. However, smaller materials
      were also formed for electrical components, furniture, tools, etc. We let heavy equipment and automated machines do all the work for us, and so we stopped practicing blacksmithing on a mass scale. The introduction
      of the automobile essentially killed multiple sectors in the blacksmithing market. Horse shoemakers and carriage builders all essentially lost their jobs in a matter of a few years. In today's world, blacksmithing
      has been rediscovered and is now viable again as blacksmiths can now make highly effective and durable melee weapons to dispatch the undead, so bullets can be saved for the real threat.

    <p>The 4-step process</p>
    <p>Gathering the raw materials</p>
    <p>
      The first step in forging a weapon is finding the materials to craft it. You can gather the raw materials in a multitude of different ways. You can gather any scrap metal you don’t need and smelt it down for scrap
      iron, a heavily used metal in the profession. Things like guns, coins, metal tools, and a couple of other items can also be smelted down for scrap and used for smelting. Another method is looting for it in shipping
      containers. Results may vary with this method. You may find more rare materials that cannot be otherwise mined like silver and zinc. But it is a gold method of getting ingots to start. The last and most reliable
      method is taking a pickaxe and doing it the old fashion way. MINING! Mining is by far the most effective way of gathering raw materials for forging. There are multiple locations scattered around Deer Isle that
      provide materials. Generally, you’ll find a mine, hit the veins with pickaxes, pipe wrenches, or sledgehammers, then you’ll break down the large chunks of ore with hammers, pipes, and crowbars (Pipes and crowbars
      are usually the most effective as they last significantly longer). You can also gather raw gems using this method which are also used for multiple different projects.

    <p>Smelting down raw materials</p>
    <p>
      Okay, so now you have all the raw materials you need. What do you do with them? You smelt them down! For this step, a blacksmith will need 3 items: a set of tongs, a crucible bucket, and an ingot mold. The first
      step would be to fill the crucible bucket with raw materials. Generally, you only need 4 pieces of ore to smelt down the metal successfully. Exceptions to this would be bronze and brass. Bronze requires 4 copper
      ore and 4 tin ore. Whilst brass requires 4 copper ore and 3 zinc ore. Once you have filled the crucible bucket, you must place it into the forge. After about 10 minutes, the ore should be smelted down and ready to
      be transported to the ingot mold. Now this next step needs to be followed VERY CAREFULLY. In order to transfer the molten metal to the ingot mold, you must take your TONGS and pick up the bucket with said TONGS
      (you would be surprised how many people I’ve met who have missed this step and suffered severe burns to their hands) and carefully pour the metal into the ingot mold. After about 10 minutes, the metal will be
      cooled enough for you to be able to pick up the ingot mold and remove the hardened metal. Now you should have 3 ingot bars of whatever metal you smelted down.

    <p>Processing the ingots into workable metal</p>
    <p>
      Once you have your ingots made and ready, they will now be able to be worked into usable materials. You’ll need your trusty tongs and a hammer for this step. Place your metal into the forge and wait until it
      reaches around 200℃. Once it reaches the desired temperature, pick up the ingots WITH YOUR TONGS and strike it with your hammer. You can turn it into either metal plates or metal rods. 2 Ingots will generally net
      you anywhere between 1-8 plates of metal whereas the same amount of ingots will get you anywhere between 1-3 rods of metal. Another use for certain metals in their ingot forms are copper and iron. Copper and iron
      can be utilized with a lathe to create copper wire and metal wire. Copper wire is generally used for electronics whereas metal wire can be used for almost anything else but is also an essential component to most
      tools and weapons you can make. You can also use pliers to achieve the same result but a lathe is significantly more effective than pliers.
    </p>
    <p>Forging of a tool/weapon</p>
    <p>
      The final step is by far the most tedious as it involves a lot of trial and error. The good news is there are generally 4-5 main components that are usually a constant. These components are Leather, metal wire,
      tarp, rope, and a log if you’re crafting something like a Warhammer, a spear, or a staff. One of the most common metals used for most tools is Iron as it is the strongest of the metals you’ll be utilizing. After
      the main components, you’ll have to mix and match a lot of different combinations of metals, both plates and rods, to be able to successfully build a weapon. Some more advanced and exquisite weapons also require
      cut gems to be able to create. In order to get your hands on and utilize these gems, you’ll have to acquire a raw gem via mining. Then you’ll need to find yourself a gem-cutting kit and use it to cut the gem into a
      usable shape. This process is arduous and you WILL have a high failure rate. Do not lose hope. With enough persistence and patience, you can easily get your hands on a good stockpile of assorted gemstones.

    <p>Some Freebies</p>
    <p>
      In order to practice your blacksmithing skills, this guidebook will provide the recipes for some common and highly useful tools that you will be using heavily in your journey to become a successful blacksmith.
      Small tongs: <br />
      2 Leather + 1 metal wire + 4 tarp + 1 rope <br />
      1 Iron plate + 1 zinc plate + 1 iron plate<br />
      1 iron rod<br />
      <br /><br />
      Hammer<br />
      2 leather + 1 metal wire + 2 tarp + 1 rope + 1 log<br />
      1 iron plate + 1 platinum plate + 1 iron plate<br />
      1 iron rod<br />
      <br /><br />
      Pickaxe<br />
      2 leather + 1 metal wire + 4 tarp + 1 rope + 1 log<br />
      1 iron plate + 1 tin plate + 1 iron plate<br />
      1 iron rod<br />
      <br /><br />
      Crucible bucket<br />
      You will not need metal for this. Just a shovel. <br />
      12 large clay chunks + 12 large clay chunks <br />
      Once made into the shape of a bucket, combine it with garden lime<br />
      Once combined with garden lime, combine with a bag of mortar mix<br />
      Throw it into the forge and it will eventually harden enough to be usable<br />
      <br /><br />
      Ingot mold<br />
      Exact same process, except after you mold the clay into the shape of the bucket, take a hammer and bash it into the shape of an ingot mold. Then repeat with the garden lime and mortar mix and throw it into the
      forge. <br />
