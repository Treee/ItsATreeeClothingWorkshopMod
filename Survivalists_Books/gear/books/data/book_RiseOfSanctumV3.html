      In the valley east of Idlehollow, they formed their settlement, which they knew as 'Rome'. Within days, the first houses had been constructed; within weeks, the walls were built; within months, the town had
      asserted itself as a central hub for activity, commerce and influence. This status of course shifted, as the settlement experienced periodic highs and lows that all groups undergo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sanctum emulated the Roman Republic and the Roman ideals, believing that the only way peace could be secured is if the capacity to enact severe violence was present. They marked people that acted outside of their
      belief for what the new world needed as 'profligates', with one name conflict being the Battle of Briarskeep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sanctum Senate designated Sirius as the Legatus for their battle against the profligate known as Svetlana, who was the mutant leader of a southern faction called the Corrupted Rose. Svetlana's prerogative was
      to learn every trade of other factions, and sell it for break-even price whilst maintaining healthy prices of her choice trades, blacksmithing and alchemy. Over a period of months, this led to a stagnant economy
      where trade was nearly non-existent. Simultaneously, she experimented with dangerous technology and unleashed it upon her own people: to name, the Smoke Monster. This Monster embodies a cloud of smoke that sweeps
      up an individual and carries them to a distant land, instilling within a foreign sickness that muddies the mind. To pair, she endeavoured to harness the ability to control the weather using a series of machines
      located around the island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Legatus Sirius *3 employed a carrot-and-stick approach, offering Svetlana a 10% discount at Rome's merchants if she ceased her actions, which she refused. Her refusal came in the form of sending her sister, Thommy,
      to threaten the life of one of Rome's citizens: a medic, known as Minerva. This threat sparked the conflict between Rome and the Corrupted Roses.
    </p>
    <p>
      They swiftly invited their allies, who were coincidentally the very people that had taught Sanctum a large portion of what they knew, in Altar to join them in the defence against Rome. Legatus Sirius mustered over
      50 people and marched on the Briarskeep castle with intent to strong-arm a surrender before conflict could begin. Before any diplomacy could take place, one of Svetlana's folk fired upon the Legion, giving way to a
      day-and-night conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Legion split itself into three forces: one was to assault the castle from the northern hill, another from the south, whilst another worked to capture any deserters from Svetlana's encampment. Legatus Sirius
      successfully captured one of her folk and persuaded the captive to play along with a bluff, promising no harm would come to him if he cooperated. Utilising short-range radios, the Legatus and Svetlana communicated
      where she was given 10 minutes to exit the castle in return for the hostage, else he would be killed. After the time was up, she chose to remain in her castle and let her member die - or so she thought. The captive
      was given the opportunity to say final words over the radio, which he used to wail about how he thought it was unfair that he was dying for Svetlana's crimes *4 before a single gunshot resounded across the
      battlefield.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, the hostage was not actually killed. Instead, after witnessing his leader choose to discard his life, he asked to live in Rome, which the Sanctum obliged.</p>
    <p>
      The Legion had been fighting for hours and all involved were growing tired. Svetlana's people had been defeated, with splashes of blood painting the snowy ground within their walls. They marched back to Rome and
      held a triumph in celebration of their victory. But one battle does not decide a war - the issue of Svetlana and her allies still existing remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following day, Legatus Sirius led a contubernium to the Altar bunker, where he demanded that the profligate Thommy who had threatened Minerva's life be delivered to him now. Thommy was the sister of Svetlana
      and a member of Altar. They sent their captain, Cowboy and their ambassador Hunter to discuss the terms of peace. The conversation ended abruptly after the two denied Rome access to the profligate, with both being
      forced to their knees and Cowboy shot in the leg for their insolence, after they began hurling insults during their captivity. They were told to stay out of the conflict, but did not heed this command immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Days later the leader of Altar, Doctor Warwick, approached the Senate of Rome alone and shared her deepest concern for her faction's involvement in the war, citing that it was a matter of principle that she wish
      she did not have to honour. Her sentinel force *5 was led by Cowboy, a temperamental man, who was not listening to her when she stated she did not want to be dragged into the war. Between Consul Tyler *6 and
      Warwick, they found common ground and agreed on a road-map for peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Corrupted Roses went underground, fleeing at the sight of legionaries, until one evening a force led by Reed, leader of a faction called 'The Draugers' captured Svetlana with the Legion's support and executed
      her. In the following days, the Roses elected a new leader called Alfie who surrendered to Rome, and in the following months trades universally increased back to their original value. Slowly, the Roses dissipated
      into nothing, with one of their members called Vergil leading a mutant-cult charge to grow the Sandy Bay flower by feeding humans to it. Rome threatened him once and he disappeared off isle, relinquishing all
      command of his house. The war was won, with supporters of Svetlana's cause paying tribute to Rome.
