    <p>
      Homo Mutagenis or "Mutants" are a unique branch of humanity owing to their remarkable potential <br />
      in that they are able to adapt to irradiated environments and consume irradiated species of animals and plant life, <br />
      they are also able to consume human flesh without contracting the Kuru disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      A common misconception that mutants face is that they all "must" consume human flesh to survive, this is false <br />
      with appropriate support networks and the necessary resources, mutants can survive and thrive without needing to consume human biomatter, <br />
      The flowers that can be found across Deer Isles enable for these alternative resources to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutants can trace their altered genetic lineage to a singular source, that being an individual going by the name of Warlock, <br />
      a man who can be considered the progenitor of the mutant subspecies and their feral counterparts. <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Mutant physiology has the potential to adapt with appropriate resources, these can grant individuals with specific abilities, <br />
      ranging from inbuilt night-vision to the ability to consume human food again which they would otherwise be unable to do <br />

      Homo Mutangenis & Mutagenis Caput Cancri aka "headcrabs" <br />
      Mutagenis Caput Cancri or "headcrabs" as they are better known reside inside of the biozones that<br />
      dot area's of Deer Isles, they are essentially walking grenades.<br />
      Headcrabs when expended are able to be skinned and consumed by mutated individuals.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Homo Mutagenis & Feral Alpha Mutants <br />
      1. Feral alpha mutants are non-sentient and will attack any who approach a nests proximity.<br />
      2. When an feral alpha mutant is defeated, they are able to be skinned and the meat also consumable by mutants.<br />
      3. Feral alpha nests contain eggs, these eggs enable a mutant to adapt their bodies to suit their needs. <br />

    <p>
      Homo Mutagenis and Mutated Wolves.<br />
      Mutated Wolves are a varation of the common wolf species <br />
      the meat that these wolves are hunted for are consumable by mutants. <br />
      Any pelts that are not to badly damaged can be used in leather based products <br />
