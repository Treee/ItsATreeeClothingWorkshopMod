      First aid, as we’ve all realized, is very important to understand and master. In this book I’ve written a few tips and tricks for every New Roman household to have on hand, just in case. With this book, I’ve
      included a basic first aid kit.

      If you don’t know your blood type, you should use the included blood kit to test it. Negative blood types can only receive negative blood, positive blood types can receive positive and negative blood. The letter
      type has to match your letter type or you will get very sick. A- can receive only A-, but A+ can receive A- and A+. People with AB blood can receive either A or B types as long as the rH factor (- or +) is
      compatible. O- is the universal donor. Anyone can receive O- blood. O+ blood is the universal recipient. If you have O+ blood they can receive any blood type

      Blood Tests and Illness<br />

      Blood tests can also tell you if you have an infection, but quite often your symptoms are enough. If you’re vomiting, you probably have salmonella or cholera. If you’re coughing it’s likely the cold or the flu.
      Here are some ways to cure common illnesses:
    </p>
    <p>
      Salmonella: Contracted by eating bad food or by a nasty swipe from an infected. if it’s in its early stages it can be helped by treating the symptoms and taking charcoal and an antibiotic or multivitamin pills. Try
      not to eat too much. Or you will become dehydrated very quickly. If salmonella has advanced too far, it is likely that you won’t be able to cure it with charcoal. At this point it is life threatening and you should
      come see me immediately! Remember to clean your wounds, cook your food, and wash your hands before eating!
    </p>
    <p>
      Cholera: cholera is a bacterial infection from drinking unclean water! If you find yourself vomiting and running a fever, you should start treating for cholera. Antibiotics, and multivitamin pills are your best bet
      to get rid of cholera. Please use the chlorine tablets I’ve provided if you’re thinking about drinking from an unknown canteen or water source.

      The common cold and it’s sister, influenza: both of these are viral illness that you can easily catch from being exposed to cold temperatures for too long. Being exposed to the cold can lower your immune system,
      therefore, when your clothes get wet, dry them out, if it’s dark and cold, find a safe place to make a fire. If you are sick with either of these illnesses, you will know due to the coughing and sneezing. Please,
      take a vitamin, wear a mask and come see me for some broad spectrum antibiotics.

      Chemical poisoning: eating burnt food or drinking gasoline is a great way to find yourself ill by chemical poisoning. The best way to avoid this is to, well, not do those things. The best cure for chemical
      poisoning by is to treat the symptoms: stay hydrated, but don’t drink too much to avoid vomiting, and take a few charcoal tablets!

      Kuru is a prionic infection of your brain from eating human meat. As you can imagine, if you come down with kuru, many people are going to have questions The best way to avoid kuru is to eat food that you or
      someone you trust prepares. Avoid eating randomly sourced unknown food cans, as cannibals like to make them with human meat, and do not eat randomly found fat. It is impossible to distinguish human from animal fat.
      Cannibals like to lay traps for unsuspecting survivors. There is a cure for Kuru, which I do have access too, but if you are found with Kuru you will be subject to investigation by the Senate of New Rome prior to
      receiving said cure.

      Sanitizing and Wound Care<br />

      It is important to make sure that your medical equipment is sterile before you use it, which is why I have included sterilized equipment in your first aid kit. Sterilizing your equipment is easy. All you have to do
      is use your alcohol that I’ve provided in your first aid kit and clean your equipment, just be careful not to dirty it again. Should you be out in the field and have forgotten your first aid kit at home, here are
      some tips for an emergency scenario:
    </p>
    <p>
      Rags are the best substitute for bandages. You can make rags from almost any clothing material by using your knife to cut them into strips. Be sure to disinfect your rags before you use them or your dirty rags will
      leave you open for infection.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you find yourself needing a blood transfusion or a saline bag, be sure to sterilize it before its use. Needles are a good way to introduce bacteria into the bloodstream and using dirty needles guarantees a nasty
      infection. If your are unsure about giving yourself an IV stick, resting and drinking n fluids after losing blood is another great way to replenish your blood volume.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the same idea as sterilizing your equipment, make sure that you also clean your wounds. Whether it be infected attacks or animals, an open wound is sure to cause an infection. Even if your attack doesn’t leave
      you bleeding, you should always check your skin and use a disinfectant on an open wound.

      Broken Bones<br />

      Setting a broken bone seems harder than it is. The best way to deal with a broken bone is to splint it. A simple splint can be made with sticks and rags. After setting the bone, be sure to give yourself time to
      heal. If out in the field, use morphine or a crude stim on yourself if bunkering down in a safe space isn’t an option. You will be able to move, but it won’t be as well as you usually can.
    </p>
    <p>This book can teach you all of the basic knowledge for first aid that will keep you alive and safe. As always practice caution and common sense when out in the field. Stay safe, New Romans.</p>
