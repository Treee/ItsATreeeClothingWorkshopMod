      THE birth of mutants has provided a golden opportunity for the human species to evolve. Through opting to mutate out of free-will, the human ensures that they shall suffer no longer from disease that plagues the
      body and mind, such as cancer or dementia; they provide themselves with unrestricted access to areas of land once locked by green mist and radiation, which behold treasures that prove vital in progressing the new
      civilisation, and they bind themselves to a family of like-minded individuals who share core values such as integrity, honesty and responsibility. THERE is nothing “simple” about mutanthood – the uninitiated mock
      and fear us, for they do not understand us, and what they do not understand, they try to control; what they cannot control, they endeavour to destroy. For all its gifts, mutation does not cure a human’s soul nor
      psychology, allowing for people with ill-will to breach a sacred bloodline and blur the lines of mutant purpose. These people are ill-born, and are recognised by receiving the mutation through a source of evil, in
      contrast to a force of good. IT is therefore critical that mutanthood is preserved by a trusted, worthy individual or family who upholds mutant values that are outlined in this text. The name of mutanthood has
      been, and always will be, tarnished by those who reject us as a people, and cannot progress from acts that took place in the distant past – without retaliation in the form of progression and maintenance, our people
      shall wither and rot.

      IT is crucial to note that anybody with the proper knowledge can create a mutation serum. Although the process is extensive, it is not impossible, which poses a risk to the bloodlines as their influence over the
      enforcement of values diminishes. This is why the value of integrity is necessary to mutanthood, and prospecting mutants. THE second mutant value is honesty – amongst the brotherhood, treachery is an offence that
      is insurmountable in severity. Trust is hard to build and easy to break. For a family to thrive, there should never be cause to question another member’s honesty, and if there is, at any point, a reason to, then
      they should be dealt with swiftly. This does not mean to kill or suppress: these are the last resorts. In the presence of the Flower, a mutant must stand trial without hostility, and answer any question presented
      to them. They should be afforded an opportunity to cement their devotion to the family and after succeeding, be welcomed back as one. Should they fail to adhere to a trial within the Flower’s presence, then they
      are not one of us and their blood has been tainted. If they do not complete an opportunity to display their devotion, they should be afforded one more chance before expulsion.

    <p>
      WE as a people must hold ourselves and each other accountable – in this new world free of official governance, it is our responsibility to protect one another, which means we must make difficult decisions, and take
      action for the good of our people. THE third mutant value is responsibility – there is nothing else except good in taking upon more responsibility, if you are capable. This is how growth occurs. A mutant that feels
      needed and more importantly, wanted, is a person that shall not endeavour to betray their family. Responsibility comes in many forms - the form of hosting rituals to help mutants thrive, such as feeding a sacrifice
      to the Flower; actively progressing mutants into a direction supported by this very book, and defending the bloodline from those that would taint it. AS a people, we are identified by what binds us together: blood.
      Those of us that entered the bloodline through a reputable and correct source are known as ‘pure-bloods’. Those of pure lineage earned their serum and place in the brotherhood through direct means, they did not
      forsake mutant values and circumvent the natural law.
    </p>
    <p>
      THOSE of us that entered the bloodline through a corrupt source, one that peddles serums in attempt to circumvent mutant law, is known as one of the ‘ill-born’. To be ill-born means that you have forsaken mutant
      law, and the path that has been set forth, for selfish gain. When given the opportunity to become one of us, they rejected it for they did not wish to be a part of our family – they only wanted the physiological
      perks, but lose the social and cultural benefits. Skylar’s mutants are prime examples of ill-born mutants: they reject human flesh, choosing to try outlaw it and subsequently let the Flowers starve, as well as
      allowing our collective strengths to wane and weaken, leading to our abilities being lost. The only cures for an ill-born mutant are death or swearing an eternal oath to the Leader of a Pure-Blood Gift-Giver, for
      that which is tainted may only be healed through dedication, trust and sacrifice.

      MUTANT LAWS. The Mutant Law is a creed that all mutants must uphold. The creed protects us and help us progress forward as one brotherhood. The first and only law is no treachery towards a mutant of pure-blood
      status. This means: no death, no theft and no action to harm. OUR people must consume human flesh regularly and feed it to the Flowers – this keeps us strong and keeps us from developing ailments that we have
      previously suffered from, to name, the loss of all mutant abilities outlined in previous texts. CONCLUSION. Our people are the next step in evolution. It is right to be proud of your blood. It is right to wish to
      preserve and progress your bloodline. Take the necessary steps towards preserving Mutant power and culture – it is your duty to keep our names alive. WRITTEN BY: ARTHUR JULIUS MERLE
