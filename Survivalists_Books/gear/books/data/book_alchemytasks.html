      The Alchemist's Oath: I, [state your name], do swear to uphold the principles of the Craft. To do no harm. <br />
      Teach those who are willing, and only accept fair trade for my services. I will remain neutral and helpful <br />
      when I wear the Society armband and will treat all my fellow Society members as family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each level in the Society requires certain tasks. These tasks teach you the craft. As you progress through the <br />
      tasks, you will advance in the Socity.

    <p>
      Alchemy Societ - Task 1 - Apprentice - The First Task<br />
      So you want to be an Alchemist? Your first task will prove your dedication and show you the work involved <br />
      in becoming an Alchemist.<br />
      Find, buy or acquire a Mortar and Pestle <br />
      Grow, dry and grind two full piles of all eight herbs. Brookmint, Dock, Green Aminita, Mint, Ribwort, Rosemary<br />
      Valarian and Yarrow.<br />
      Bring the herbs to an Adept Alchemist for your next tasks and entry into the Society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Welcome to the Alchemy Society - Task 2 - Novice - The First Recipes<br />
      You have completed your first task.<br />
      01-05-08-02-06<br />
      Use this riddle to find your first recipe. Place the herbs in the proper order and mash with 6 pristine rags <br />
      Remove the bright orange pile and replace with dangerous Amanita. Find the proper order and your bandage will <br />
      have antibiotic properties.<br />
      Now, replace Ribwort with a Minty herb. Scramble once again and you will produce a bandage that helps <br />
      with shock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alchemy Society - Task 3 - Novice - The Discovery Process<br />
      Each recipe has three possible herbs that will work in each of the five slots. Find all the herbs for each slot.<br />
      Fill the mortar with a known recipe.<br />
      Replace each herb in slot one with a new herb. Use the rags to test the combination. It will indicate a valid <br />
      recipe.<br />
      Record your findings without completing the mixing process.<br />
      Repeat for each slot to find all the possibilities for that recipe.
    </p>

      Alchemy Society - Task 4 - Novice - Finding the Optimal Recipe<br />
      1. Load the mortar with a known recipe with full piles of herbs.<br />
      2. Use the reagent to make the recipe and record how much of each herb was used.<br />
      3. Reload the mortar with the next unique recipe, making sure each slot has a new herb. <br />
      4. Make the recipe and record the results.<br />
      5. Repeat one more time. Study your notes to see which herb uses the least amount for each of the slots. <br />
      That is your optimal recipe.
