    <title>The Rise Of Sanctum - Volume 1</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <br />
    <p>This is the first volume in my series of books that dictate the founding and progression of one of the island's factions, known as Sanctum to some, Rome others, the Legion to the rest.</p>
    <p>
      Sanctum officially emerged as a faction on the 8th May 2007, created by five people: Sirius, Tyler, Durka, Island George and Liah. Many groups are born out of an influx of wealth in their favour, inspiring them to
      officialise their status; Sanctum, on the other hand, was the inverse. The founding five were previously members of a merchant called the 'Broken Arrow Outfitters', which was the first Lock and Sons affiliated shop
      on the island. After being betrayed by their affiliate-brothers the Arbitration, who aligned themselves with the STAG and Cult of Warlock, it was impossible to continue viable business operations, thus causing the
      five to seek literal sanctum away from the heat *1.

      To the far west they retreated, establishing quiet shelter on the outskirts of Old Town in a run-down warehouse adjacent to a shipping yard. For many months they remained dormant, demotivated to build anything
      substantial out of fear it would be torn down again. They felt discarded by the island, and wanted nothing to do with it. Throughout the summer, they spent their time learning the carpentry trade and within the six
      long months that they called Old Town home, they constructed a fortress out of the old shipping yard using new schematics otherwise unseen before.

      It was the morning of a warm summer's day that the five chose to sail out to sea with intent to fish - but they never made it that far. As if summoned out of nowhere, a thick storm swept their boat astray and
      rendered them into the waves with such force that it rendered them unconscious. For how long they were asleep it is not known, but when they came to, they found themselves deep in a foreign cavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      The salty stench of the sea clung to the roof of their mouths as they mustered from the floor and tried to make sense of where they were. It was visibly a dead-end to whatever tunnel system they had been
      transported to. At the first side of one wall was a carved entrance illuminated by an ancient fire scone, big enough to fit through but small enough to instil a dreading sense of claustrophobia that they feared
      would only build as they pathed their way through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Onwards they pushed, traversing the tunnel system and navigating with their hands. The lights were few and far between, and each one looked older than the one before it. This place had an unfamiliar atmosphere to
      it, something unlike anywhere they had ever been before.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they pushed through the tunnels, it became increasingly obvious that the cave was no longer...a cave, but more like a tomb. The walls became increasingly fortified: in place of jagged rock stood old long format
      brick, serving as a silent guide towards their destination. After what felt like an age of wandering, the five arrived in a wide, open room and past that, an oval hall that put modern churches and cathedrals to
      shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sight was nothing short of spectacular. The floor was a complete, colourful mosaic; the walls were decorated in Roman-esque paintings, banners, depictions of legions with shelves to match, complete with
      trinkets and texts, and the ceiling was... alluring. A figure formed out of stone, evidently an Emperor, draped in full triumphal decorum, with golden yellow eyes that danced in the light of the fire.

    <p>You could have stayed here an eternity, and still had more to discover.</p>
    <p>
      The end of this room connected to something that beckoned them closer, however. Onwards they marched, unified in wonder at their surroundings, until they stepped into the final chamber of this system. It was an
      enormous, ancient concrete room with a small circular opening at the top, permitting a sliver of moonlight entry.
    </p>
    <p>
      A narrow brick pathway snaked around a massive grassy expanse. In the centre of the room stood a towering stone that reached into the sky, as if it were a monument from a forgotten age. Etched deep into the surface
      was a strange, mysterious symbol that filled the otherwise dark room with a warm, golden hue - the same colour as the Emperor's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Withered skeletons lay at the base of the stone, the 'Obelisk', with their Roman armour and weapons beside them. Creeping ever closer, the five laid their palms upon the stone's surface, not knowing their contact
      would serve as the catalyst for a wave of energy to blast from the glowing sigil and send them flying into the atmosphere, rendering them unconscious once more.
