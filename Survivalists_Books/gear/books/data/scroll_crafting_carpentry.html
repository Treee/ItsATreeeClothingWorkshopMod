      In my line of work a tradesmans craft is his secret but with the
      apocalypse ruining any chance at winning woodworking awards I feel the
      need to immortalize my craft on paper. Written here are a few recipes for
      success.

      I once made the most beautiful dresser and no one ever got to see it. Such
      a shame to waste beauty. If I remember correctly, I felled several tall
      trees and fashioned the straightest planks you ever saw. Once finished, I
      hammered the boards together and used the extra to make a drawer that
      slides in. Be careful though, you might fall into the void with all that
      space.

      The mind is a terrible thing to waste especially when the most dangerous
      game can sit across from you while playing. A chess board can provide the
      perfect battlefield to prove your mettle against rivals. The finest board
      can be fashioned from the wood of a large tree. The pieces are carved from
      bark; the finer the wood the better. Settle your scores on the board
      instead of with bullets.

      Some people say the age of enlightenment was in the early 1700s but I say
      it is today. The world is so dark but if you can hang lights you can
      brighten someone's day. The easiest way to make a street lampost is
      fashion some straight planks from tall trees. Take those planks and nail
      them together to make an L shaped post. Place your post and brighten the
      world. If you have leftover planks try making a table. The hardest part is
      ensuring the legs are the same length.

      You are thriving in the world destroyed by the walking dead and need a
      place to store all your gear but without the risk of anything being
      stolen. So you need to know how to build walls, doors, and simple
      barricades. Luckily the basics are quite simple. First find small sticks
      that can form the frame of what you want. Take rope and bind it together
      so it holds the shape. You can make many barriers this way to secure your
      goods.
