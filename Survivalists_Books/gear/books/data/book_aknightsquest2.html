      Congratulations, you are truly a gentleman and an explorer too, your feats are noteworthy, courage true and you are truly an intellectual. Though more tasks await, for there is always knowledge to be uncovered
      scrolls to document and catalogue. The following tasks are not for the faint of heart, only those who show conviction and true grit shall succeed.
    </p>
    <p>Hunter</p>
    <p>Hone your tracking and hunting skills, bring the guild the head of the following animals, this will show that your art is being perfected. <br />Goat, Pig, Boar, Cow, Sheep, Wolf</p>
    <p>Grizzly</p>
    <p>
      While the last task is to help perfect skinning and using the remains, this shall improve your tracking, for a knight must be efficient and smooth in their movements. Bring the guild the heads of the following
      animals.
      <br />
      Deer, Moose, Mutated Wolf, Bear
    </p>
    <p>Grand Knight</p>
    <p>
      You have passed all the trials, you are now an explorer that has gone far and wide, learned much on your travels and honed your tools to be accurate, now you must perform perhaps the greatest feat yet. To be an
      apex predator, you must take down not one, but many alphas. <br />
      This task will be the culmination of all your knowledge. Take down the alpha, claim its head for yourself and return with four of the highest quality pelts. You will truly then be worthy of the title knight.
