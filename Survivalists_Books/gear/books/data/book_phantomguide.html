    <p>The First Day Of My Last</p>
    <p>That isn't what you think it means. Of course, the last day of any sort of thing for anyone is one of change. This one? It was quite an odd day of change.</p>
    <p>As the sweat drops mixed with blood, I stared grimly down at the corpse of Deacon Williams, the man I put out of his misery. I murdered him for a better world. Why you might ask?</p>
    <p>He suffered. I took his suffering away. A man's suffering was ended by me in this apocalypse, isn't that good? I'm doing a good thing. But, this isn't what I mean about The First Day Of My Last.</p>
    <p>
      The First Day Of My Last referred to the change that happened five minutes later. The Phantom. A killer. A man who had been looking for me for almost a year now. Kyle Zaal was his name. A man of pure evil. No
      longer do I end the suffering of the living, but, now, I end the evil. What better man is there than me?

    <p>The Lord Of Death</p>
    <p>I remember when his blood drenched the streets, well there's did.</p>
    <p>Nine people who I saved from suffering: Terry, Ethan, Xavier, Richard, Mike, Zach, Sarah, Oscar, Kalore</p>
    <p>
      The last one was intriguing, he didn’t squirm when I took their nails. When I soaked their feet in muddy waters. When I drenched their faces in the sweet smell of gasoline. Even if their horrified faces didn’t show
      it, I could tell by the way their hands shook subtly, and seeing their heart beat from their chest, they were scared. But Kalore? No.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kalore showed me something the others hadn't. I found him in the woods by Oceanville, speaking in mumbles and of a man named Lord Death. From his words: "My lord has left me be, but in my final moments I shall
      honor him. Though one man you are, as I once was, you will do well . . . . Say the name of the Lord Death and his right hand, you, you will be his new right hand. Together you shall end the suffering of those who
      live on this island. And then they shall know of true peace. Mutants. Humans. No different. All die. Genocide. All of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Long story short, Kalore taught me that in order for peace--my goal--to be achieved, we must follow Lord Death’s ways. Of course, though small, I single-handedly do all of Lord Death’s goals, and find peace through
      the land. It appears like I will finally not be alone in my goals. I am here for you, Lord Death. Let us change the world, and end the suffering of all.
    </p>
    <p>My true name is not of importance, but I am Lord Death’s right hand. I am his pawn. I am The Phantom.</p>
    <p>
      Always remember, we die someday, regardless of how long, Altar, Arbiters, Crows, Green Mountain, The North, Espen, STAG, mutants, Observer. You sit there and spit out your useless words. Mine? Mine mean something.
      The infected are my army. They are Lord Death's children. Me? I am his. I belong to him.
    </p>
    <p>Be wary, as when you read this, a snap of a stick, a single breath from you, your life could be over.</p>
