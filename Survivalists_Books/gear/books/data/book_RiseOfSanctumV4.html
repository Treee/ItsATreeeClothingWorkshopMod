      After the victory, Sanctum became more commonly known as 'Rome' or simply the 'Legion. They led a series of attacks against a mafia that had been robbing their citizens before the decisive blow came after Legatus
      Sirius negotiated a deal with the mafia's landlords, where the landlords let the Legion into the mafia's home. Here, Legatus Sirius and Consul Tyler captured the leading members of the mafia and had their homes
      ransacked before walking them out of the landlord's territory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rome then fought a satanic cult that attempted to assassinate Legatus Sirius and sacrifice a centurion *7 known as Nick, the husband of Minerva. The conflict ended in the two figureheads of the cult being
      crucified, with Nick and Minerva being promoted to the rank of Praetorian *8 in light of increased tensions around the island and their joined effectiveness in battle. It was here that Legatus Sirius was promoted
      to Consul of Rome alongside Tyler.

    <p>
      During this time, the Legion's ranks swelled and Rome became the powerhouse for the spread and influence of upgraded architecture and infrastructure. The settlement worked with other settlements and factions to
      fortify their homes and upgrade their defences, forming a network with neighbouring peoples in the region. Several notable members of the Legion otherwise unnamed include Augustus, Venator, Scipio, Minerva, Fides,
      Servia, Lazarus, Gaius, Titus, Octavia and Island George - all of which were fundamental in the daily upkeep of Rome, alongside her citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an age, Rome enjoyed a period of peace and prosperity which aligned with that of the Pax Romana *9, until a conspiracy that put the Legion at odds with a faction known as the Reapers came to fruition. A man
      known simply as 'The Old Man' conspired with numerous other agents embedded across the island to spread rumour that the Reapers were a cannibalistic tribe, with their members belonging to mutant cults.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rome was fed false information by numerous different people, with mixtures of truth embedded. A significant incident during this time was the death of Captain Cowboy of Altar, who was operating against his leader's
      command to foster positive relations with the Reapers. Cowboy was overheard on a radio frequency seemingly approaching Rome with hostile intent, to which the Legion responded with an act of force by speaking to the
      Doctor John Halligan of Altar who was residing at Rome for the night. He agreed to act as a hostage with the objective of quelling Cowboy's march on the settlement. They spoke of ideological difference and shared
      warm relations during his stay; he was not harmed, was fed and watered, and was about to be released after Cowboy had arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon Cowboy's arrival, a member claiming to "not be an Altar member" was captured after spotted overwatching Rome. He was draped from head to toe in Altar uniform, but Dr Halligan and Cowboy vehemently denied any
      affiliation, citing that he was a mere looter who had picked up their kit from some place. Thankfully, an onlooker known as 'Jack of the Mad Kuntz' *10 identified the member as Cole of Altar, and the lies of Cowboy
      and Halligan were exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rome demanded that Cowboy, Cole and Halligan kiss the Roman standard as an apology for lying in front of the Temple to Aurelian, Rome's sacred building. Cole complied, Halligan denied and so did Cowboy. Cowboy
      continued to speak over Consul Sirius after repeated demand to cease interruption, which eventually lead to his execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      After letting Altar take their captain out of Rome in a bodybag, news travelled fast to the Reapers ears of Cowboy's execution, to which they threatened to destroy Rome. This, combined with the Old Man and his
      agent's lies, brought both peoples to the brink of war. However, due to the efforts of Illusive, a long-standing merchant on the island, leadership of both peoples was brought together and a meeting took place at
      Rome, where the true conspirators were exposed and the truth revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Old Man was summoned to Rome, where his former leader Hubbard of the former Republic of Duskar executed him with Rome's support after the Old Man attempted to kill both Hubbard and several legionaries. His
      death served as an end to the chaos, and Rome and the Reapers enjoyed warm relations afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was this incident that served as the final series of victories of Sirius's that caused the Senate and People of Rome to propose a motion that awarded him full executive power over the Legion and settlement, and
      promoted him to the position of Caesar for a period of 80 years. Augustus was subsequently promoted to Consul alongside Tyler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sirius's first act as Caesar was to upgrade the housing and defences of Rome, creating a secure community for citizens by reinforcing home walls with steel rods and metal lining, allowing them to serve as part of
      an actual wall. A small coronation ceremony was held, with the spine of a Cult of Warlock member known as Abel being fashioned into a headpiece to serve as a crown. In recognition of Consul Tyler's wisdom and
      counsel throughout the year, Caesar constructed another headpiece from the bones of another Cult of Warlock member known only as 'the Flesh Mask Man', who wore a mask of flesh from his victims. These headpieces
      have become symbols of the justice that Rome provides to those that prey upon the weak.
