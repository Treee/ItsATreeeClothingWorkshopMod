      The meteoric rise of the Emperor is both shrouded in mystery and myth. Countless tales of how he came to power are whispered among his people as well as how he came unto this world. Some say he is the embodiment of
      human perfection, genetically engineered, by the worlds most brilliant minds. Standing nearly 7 feet tall his impressive physique is only surpassed by his cunning and ability to inspire undying loyalty. Regardless
      of the truth of his birth, he is the one true ruler of mankind. Blessed with unequalled martial prowess, genius level tactician and possessing such charisma, most can barely stand to look upon his face for more
      than a few heartbeats. Legend says he discovered a vast cache of weaponry and equipment hidden in a great cave complex, below the Appalachian Mountains. From there he built his army of devout brothers, marching out
      across the wasted landscapes. Many flocked to his banners, for the empire offers stability and purpose to this dying world. With the Emperor leading an ever growing army, his legions spread across the Americas
      uniting tribes, settlements and defeating any foe mad enough to try and stand against him. Eradicating those who lost their way, bathing all "agents of chaos" in the fires of enlightenment. Every action, every
      battle is filled with a singular purpose, to bring his vison of an enlightened civilization and root out the darkness that threatens our world. Scouring the planet for lost tech and advancements in genetics,
      gathering the greatest minds the world has left as we are no longer constrained by morality or religion, in an effort to propel our empire into a new age of dominion. Soon we shall reclaim our place in the world in
      his name and not even the stars will be out of his reach. The small remnants of civilization around the Washington D.C. area have formed into the future of the American east coast, and maybe all of mankind.
